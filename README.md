Sure, here's a README.md file for your Chronic Conditions application. Please modify it as needed to reflect the specifics of your application.

# Chronic Conditions App
The Chronic Conditions application is a tool designed to streamline the process of summarizing PubMed abstracts related to various chronic conditions. The summaries are organized by chronic condition and month/year for easy accessibility and user-friendly comprehension. 

## Overview

The application uses Google's BigQuery for data storage and retrieval and OpenAI's GPT-3 for natural language processing. It provides a summary of research on specified chronic conditions by month and year, using the GPT-3 model to summarize abstracts from PubMed.

## Features
1. **Interactive UI** - Utilizes Streamlit to provide a clean and interactive user interface.
2. **Data Filtering** - Allows users to filter research by chronic condition, date, and keywords.
3. **Data Visualization** - Generates a line plot of the number of studies over time for each chronic condition.
4. **Research Summaries** - Provides GPT-3 generated summaries of research abstracts.
5. **Research Source Links** - Provides direct links to the source abstracts on PubMed for further reading.

## Installation and Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies using the requirements.txt file.

```
git clone <repository url>
cd <local directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit application using the following command:

```
streamlit run <app_file.py>
```

## Data Sources
The application fetches data from PubMed, a free resource that provides access to the MEDLINE database of citations, abstracts, and some full text articles on life sciences and biomedical topics. The application also uses Google BigQuery for storing and retrieving data.

## Disclaimer
This application uses GPT-3, a powerful AI model, for summarizing the abstracts. While GPT-3 is highly advanced, the summaries it generates may not perfectly represent the content of the original abstracts. Therefore, users are encouraged to read the original abstracts for comprehensive understanding.
