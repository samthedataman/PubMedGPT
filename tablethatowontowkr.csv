0,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,37190678,[From transfer to transition: review and proposition of the SFNDT dialysis Commission].,"Over the course of their disease, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will be treated by several kidney replacement therapy (KRT) modalities. The transitions between KRT modalities can be experienced as traumatic by patients, and are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality, notably when they are not anticipated. Planning these transition phases could reduce the psychological trauma induced by the transfer, as well as reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality. However, the lack of a clear definition of a transfer, and the lack of criteria enabling the identification of patients at risk of transfer, prevents the anticipation of these transition phases at high risk for patients. We here discuss the various possible causes and risk factors of transfer from peritoneal dialysis (PD) to hemodialysis as well as transfer from hemodialysis to PD. The dialysis Commission of the Société francophone de néphrologie, dialyse et transplantation (SFNDT) makes some proposals to improve transition phases, such as the identification of patients at risk, specific PD programs for unplanned PD start, transition unit and hybrid therapy.
Dans le parcours de soins du patient insuffisant rénal chronique, les différentes modalités de suppléance rénale vont se succéder dans le temps créant ainsi des phases de transition. Ces phases de transition peuvent être vécues comme traumatisantes par les patients, et sont associées à une augmentation de la morbi-mortalité, particulièrement lorsqu’elles ne sont pas suffisamment anticipées. La planification de ces phases de transition par l’équipe de dialyse devrait permettre de diminuer l’expérience du traumatisme psychologique induit par le changement et de réduire le risque de sur-morbi-mortalité. Cependant, l’absence de définition standardisée de la phase de transition entre modalités, le manque de critères et d’outils identifiant les patients à risque de transfert et l’absence d’infrastructures dédiées à ces patients transitionnels sont autant de facteurs limitant l’anticipation de ces phases de transition. Nous abordons ici les différentes causes et possibles facteurs de risque du transfert de la dialyse péritonéale (DP) vers l’hémodialyse ainsi que du transfert de l’hémodialyse vers la DP. Dans cette mise au point, la Commission de dialyse de la Société francophone de néphrologie, dialyse et transplantation (SFNDT) émet certaines propositions pour améliorer la définition et la prise en charge de ces phases de transition, et propose des outils d’identification des sujets « transitionnels » ainsi que des exemples structurels de programmes soutenant la transition, tels que le démarrage en urgence de la DP, l’unité transitionnelle et la dialyse hybride.","['dialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'hemodialysis', 'transfer', 'transit']",Nephrologie & therapeutique,2023-05-16,"[{'lastname': 'Boyer', 'firstname': 'Annabel', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre universitaire des maladies rénales, CHU de Caen, Avenue de la côte de Nacre, 14033 Caen Cedex 9, France\nU1086 Inserm-Anticipe, Centre régional de lutte contre le cancer François Baclesse, 3, avenue du général Harris, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France'}, {'lastname': 'Lanot', 'firstname': 'Antoine', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre universitaire des maladies rénales, CHU de Caen, Avenue de la côte de Nacre, 14033 Caen Cedex 9, France\nU1086 Inserm-Anticipe, Centre régional de lutte contre le cancer François Baclesse, 3, avenue du général Harris, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France\nNormandie Université, Unicaen, UFR de médecine, 2, rue des Rochambelles, 14032 Caen Cedex, France'}, {'lastname': 'Legendre', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Centre universitaire des maladies rénales, CHU de Caen, Avenue de la côte de Nacre, 14033 Caen Cedex 9, France\nU1086 Inserm-Anticipe, Centre régional de lutte contre le cancer François Baclesse, 3, avenue du général Harris, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France'}, {'lastname': 'Clause', 'firstname': 'Anne-Lorraine', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'Hôpital Erasme, ULB, département de néphrologie, dialyse et transplantation, Route de Lennik 808, 1070 Bruxelles, Belgique'}, {'lastname': 'Kabbali', 'firstname': 'Nadia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Hôpital universitaire Hassan II, service néphrologie, dialyse et transplantation, Fez, Maroc\nLaboratoire d’épidémiologie et de recherche en sciences de la santé (ERESS), Faculté de médecine, Université Sidi Mohammed Ben Abdellah, Fez, Maroc'}, {'lastname': 'Lobbedez', 'firstname': 'Thierry', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Centre universitaire des maladies rénales, CHU de Caen, Avenue de la côte de Nacre, 14033 Caen Cedex 9, France\nU1086 Inserm-Anticipe, Centre régional de lutte contre le cancer François Baclesse, 3, avenue du général Harris, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France\nNormandie Université, Unicaen, UFR de médecine, 2, rue des Rochambelles, 14032 Caen Cedex, France'}, {'lastname': 'Bechade', 'firstname': 'Clémence', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centre universitaire des maladies rénales, CHU de Caen, Avenue de la côte de Nacre, 14033 Caen Cedex 9, France\nU1086 Inserm-Anticipe, Centre régional de lutte contre le cancer François Baclesse, 3, avenue du général Harris, 14076 Caen Cedex 5, France\nNormandie Université, Unicaen, UFR de médecine, 2, rue des Rochambelles, 14032 Caen Cedex, France'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,10.1684/ndt.2023.17,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x16ea9b3d0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,37190678,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37190678,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

12695723",Matrix Metalloproteinase-7 Associated with Congestive Heart Failure in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) is markedly expressed in patients with chronic kidney disease; its expression in dialysate and role in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) have not been well established.
Participants undergoing PD from June 1st, 2015, to June 30th, 2020, were involved and were followed up every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months thereafter until death, PD withdrawal, or the end of the study. Data at each follow-up point were collected and analyzed for the association with congestive heart failure (CHF), PD withdrawal, and combined endpoint.
A total of 283 participants were included in this study. During a median follow-up of 21 months, 20 (7%) participants died, 93 (33%) withdrew from PD, and 105 (37%) developed CHF. A significantly increased level of serum and dialysate MMP7 was observed at baseline. Dialysate MMP7 presented a good linearity with serum MMP7. Baseline serum and dialysate MMP7 levels were associated with CHF in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. After categorization, participants with high baseline MMP7 levels had a higher incidence of CHF (42%), and the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were 1.595 (1.023-2.488). Interestingly, participants with higher serum MMP7 levels were trended to use dialysate with higher glucose concentration. However, the ultrafiltration volumes were not significantly increased. Higher MMP7 levels were also positively associated with PD withdrawal and combined endpoint.
The expression of MMP7 in serum and dialysate was markedly increased and was tightly associated with the risk of CHF in PD patients. This finding suggests that the measurement of MMP7 may inform strategies for managing CHF at an earlier stage.",[],Mediators of inflammation,2023-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Xiao', 'firstname': 'Zhiwen',

18218989",Associated factors of cardiac valve calcification and its prognostic effects among patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Cardiac valve calcification (CVC) is highly prevalent and a risk factor for adverse outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the risk factors for CVC and association between CVC and mortality in CKD patients.
Three electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies up to November 2022. Hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled using random-effect meta-analyses.
22 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analyses showed that CKD patients with CVC were relatively older, had a higher body mass index, left atrial dimension, C-reaction protein level, and a declined ejection fraction. Calcium and phosphate metabolism dysfunction, diabetes, coronary heart disease, and duration of dialysis were all predictors for CVC in CKD patients. The presence of CVC (both aortic valve and mitral valve) increased the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in CKD patients. However, the prognostic value of CVC for mortality was not significant anymore in patients with peritoneal dialysis.
CKD patients with CVC had a greater risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Multiple associated factors for development of CVC in CKD patients should be taken into consideration by healthcare professionals to improve prognosis.

26516337",The Assessment of Male Erectile Dysfunction Characteristics in Patients Undergoing Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis and Hemodialysis Using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) Combined with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales.,"To determine the differences in mean scores of erectile dysfunctions (EDs) assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire between patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis and patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).
This is an analytic observational study with a cross-sectional design that was conducted from June to December 2022 at the Urology Center of Haji Adam Malik General Hospital and Rasyida Kidney Specialized Hospital. The sample of this study were male CKD-patients who underwent regular hemodialysis (HD) and who underwent CAPD, and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Psychological disorders experienced during therapy session are considered as risk factors and assessed via the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). These disorders assessment was used to evaluate the severity of the patients' anxiety and depressive symptoms. Statistical data analysis was carried out.
Both groups had HADS-A and HADS-D scores with an average <7, classified as normal anxiety and depression. Most of the patients in the HD group had mild-to-moderate ED (28.6%), while in the CAPD group had mild severity of ED (38.1%). There were no significant differences in severity of ED between patients undergoing HD and CAPD (p > 0.05). However, there was a significant difference in ED scores (IIEF-5) between patients undergoing HD and those with CAPD (p < 0.05), in which patients in the CAPD group had a higher IIEF-5 score. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation with moderate strength (p<0.001;

4,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,37179480,[Nephrological nutritional office: a transversal organization model and access flowchart].,"The nutritional aspect has a critical relevance in the educational and care path of nephropathic patients. The Nephrology-Dietology synergy in the Hospital is conditioned by various factors, such as the difficulty for Dietology to provide capillary and personalized follow-up to nephropathic patients. Hence the experience of a transversal II level nephrological clinic, dedicated to nutritional aspects throughout the path of nephropathic patients, from the earliest stages of kidney disease to replacement treatment. The access flowchart provides a nephrological indication: from chronic kidney disease (CKD), kidney stones, immunopathology, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and transplantation clinics, from the nephrological department, patients are selected for evaluation. The clinic is conducted by an expert nephrologist and trained dietitians, and is divided into different settings: educational meetings in small groups (patients and caregivers); simultaneous dietary and nephrological visits to advanced CKD; nutritional-nephrological visits on specific problems: from metabolic screening of kidney stones to action on the intestinal microbiota in immunological pathologies, to the application of the ketogenic diet in obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and early kidney damage, to onconephrology. Submission to further dietological assessment is limited to critical and selected cases. The synergistic model between nephrology and dietetics offers clinical and organizational advantages: guarantees a capillary follow-up, reduces the number of hospital accesses, thus enhancing compliance and clinical outcomes, optimizes available resources, and overcomes the critical issues of a complex hospital with the advantage of the always profitable multidisciplinarity.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dietetic-nutritional therapy', 'nephrology']",Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,2023-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Vischi', 'firstname': 'Margherita', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'SC Nefrologia e Dialisi, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo Milano.'}, {'lastname': 'Moreschi', 'firstname': 'Benedetta', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'SSD Servizio Dietetico e Nutrizione Clinica-ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo Milano.'}, {'lastname': 'Zanoni', 'firstname': 'Cristina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'SSD Servizio Dietetico e Nutrizione Clinica-ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo Milano.'}, {'lastname': 'Raschioni', 'firstname': 'Enrica', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'SSD Servizio Dietetico e Nutrizione Clinica-ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo Milano.'}, {'lastname': 'Lanzi', 'firstname': 'Paola', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'SSD Servizio Dietetico e Nutrizione Clinica-ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo Milano.'}, {'lastname': 'Orfeo', 'firstname': 'Nicola Vincenzo', 'initials': 'NV', 'affiliation': 'Direzione Sanitaria ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo Milano.'}, {'lastname': 'Cozzolino', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'SC Nefrologia e Dialisi, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo Milano.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright by Società Italiana di Nefrologia SIN, Rome,Italy.",None,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x16ea77a60>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,37179480,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37179480,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan
5,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,37179214,Vascular calcification in peritoneal dialysis patients and its association with bone-derived molecules and bone histomorphometry.,"Data regarding vascular calcification (VC) in contemporary peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients is scarce. Bone-vascular axis has been demonstrated in hemodialysis (HD). However, studies showing the link between bone disease and VC in PD patients are lacking. The role of sclerostin, dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK-1), receptor activator for nuclear factor kB ligand and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in VC in PD remains to clarify.
Bone biopsy was performed in 47 prevalent PD patients with histomorphometric analysis. Patients were submitted to pelvis and hands X-ray to evaluate VC using the Adragão score (AS). Relevant clinical and biochemical data was collected.
Thirteen patients (27.7%) had positive AS (AS≥1). Patients with VC were significantly older (58.9 vs. 50.4 years, p=0.011), had a lower dialysis dose (KT/V 2.0 vs. 2.4, p=0.025) and a higher glycosylated hemoglobin (7.2 vs. 5.4%, p=0.001). There was not any laboratorial parameter of mineral and bone disease used in clinical practice different between patients with or without VC. All diabetic patients had VC but only 8.1% of non-diabetic had VC (p<0.001). Patients with VC showed significantly higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (91.1 vs. 60.0mm/h, p=0.001), sclerostin (2250.0 vs. 1745.8pg/mL, p=0.035), DKK-1 (1451.6 vs. 1042.9pg/mL, p=0.041) and OPG levels (2904.9 vs. 1518.2pg/mL, p=0.002). On multivariate analysis, only ESR remained statistically significant (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.01-1.14; p=0.022). Bone histomorphometric findings were not different in patients with VC. There was no correlation between bone formation rate and AS (r=-0.039; p=0.796).
The presence of VC was not associated with bone turnover and volume evaluated by bone histomorphometry. Inflammation and diabetes seem to play a more relevant role in VC in PD.","['Alteraciones del metabolismo óseo-mineral en la enfermedad renal crónica', 'Biopsia ósea', 'Bone biopsy', 'Calcificación vascular', 'Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder', 'Diálisis peritoneal', 'Osteodistrofia renal', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Renal osteodystrophy', 'Vascular calcification']",Nefrologia,2023-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'Luciano', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Investigation and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; INEB - National Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal; Department of Nephrology, São João Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal; School of Medicine of University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.

However, whether LPD is effective in preventing loss of kidney function is controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between LPD and renal outcomes.
We conducted a multicenter cohort study of 325 patients who suffered CKD stage 4 and 5 with eGFR ≥ 10ml/min/1.73m
During a mean follow-up of 4.1 ± 2.2 years. 33 patients (10.2%) died of all causes, 163 patients (50.2%) needed to start RRT and 6 patients (1.8%) received a renal transplant. LPD therapy of 0.5 g/kg/day or less was significantly related to a lower risk of RRT and all-cause mortality [Hazard ratio = 0.656; 95% confidence interval, 0.438 to 0.984, p=0.042].
These results suggest that non-supplemented LPD therapy of 0.5 g/kg/day or less may prolong the initiation of RRT in stage 4 and 5 CKD patients.","['CKD', 'cohort study', 'low-protein diet', 'renal survival']",Journal of renal nutrition : the official journal of the Council on Renal Nutrition of the National Kidney Foundation,2023-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Otani', 'firstname': 'Haruhisa', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Kisen Kidney Disease Clinic, Wakayama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Okada', 'firstname': 'Tadashi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hakuyu Chiyoda Clinic, Osaka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Saika', 'firstname': 'Yasushi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Fujii Hospital, Osaka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sakagashira', 'firstname': 'Michiko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Kisen Kidney Disease Clinic, Wakayama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Oda', 'firstname': 'Hiroaki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Oda Medical Clinic, Hiroshima, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ito', 'firstname': 'Yoshiaki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Kiyosu Clinic, Kiyosu Aichi, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yasuda', 'firstname': 'Takashi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Kichijoji Asahi Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kanno', 'firstname': 'Takeo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, Department of Nutrition and Life Science, Kanagawa Institute of Technology, Kanagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shimazui', 'firstname': 'Miyuki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Health Sciences, Showa University Graduate School, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamao', 'firstname': 'Shoko', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nutrition, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Kanagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kanazawa', 'firstname': 'Yoshie', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Nutrition, Tokyo Kaseigakuin University, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shimode', 'firstname': 'Machiko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Fujii Hospital, Osaka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Otani', 'firstname': 'Mami', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Kisen Kidney Disease Clinic, Wakayama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ueda', 'firstname': 'Shinichiro', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics, University of The Ryukyu School of Medicine, Nishihara, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakao', 'firstname': 'Toshiyuki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Organization for Kidney and Metabolic Disease Treatment, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoshimura', 'firstname': 'Ashio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Shin-Yokohama Daiichi Clinic, Yokohama, Japan; Department of Medicine, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.

30604150",Choice of the Dialysis Modality: Practical Considerations.,"Chronic kidney disease and the need for kidney replacement therapy have increased dramatically in recent decades. Forecasts for the coming years predict an even greater increase, especially in low- and middle-income countries, due to the rise in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases and the aging population. Access to kidney replacement treatments may not be available to all patients, making it especially strategic to set up therapy programs that can ensure the best possible treatment for the greatest number of patients. The choice of the ""ideal"" kidney replacement therapy often conflicts with medical availability and the patient's tolerance. This paper discusses the pros and cons of various kidney replacement therapy options and their real-world applicability limits.","['chronic kidney disease (CKD)', 'conventional hemodialysis', 'home hemodialysis', 'incremental dialysis', 'kidney replacement therapy (KRT)', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'predialysis education']",Journal of clinical medicine,2023-05-13,"[{'lastname': 'Torreggiani', 'firstname': 'Massimo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Néphrologie et Dialyse, Centre Hospitalier Le Mans, 194 Avenue Rubillard, 72037 Le Mans, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Piccoli', 'firstname': 'Giorgina Barbara', 'initials': 'GB', 'affiliation': 'Néphrologie et Dialyse, Centre Hospitalier Le Mans, 194 Avenue Rubillard, 72037 Le Mans, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Moio', 'firstname': 'Maria Rita', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'Néphrologie et Dialyse, Centre Hospitalier Le Mans, 194 Avenue Rubillard, 72037 Le Mans, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Conte', 'firstname': 'Ferruccio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Renal Division, Department of Health Sciences, Uiniversity of Milan, San Paolo Hospital, 20142 Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Magagnoli', 'firstname': 'Lorenza', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Renal Division, Department of Health Sciences, Uiniversity of Milan, San Paolo Hospital, 20142 Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Ciceri', 'firstname': 'Paola', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Renal Division, Department of Health Sciences, Uiniversity of Milan, San Paolo Hospital, 20142 Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Cozzolino', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Renal Division, Department of Health Sciences, Uiniversity of Milan, San Paolo Hospital, 20142 Milan, Italy.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/jcm12093328

31940463",Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus: what is known and its application in children.,"Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) or uremic pruritus (UP) is a frequent symptom in patients with kidney failure receiving kidney replacement therapy. Severe chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus correlates with poor outcome in patients on dialysis. It is multifactorial in etiology and has a significant impact on quality of life. There is, however, limited data for children. This review summarizes current epidemiology, clinical characteristics, pruritus scoring systems, and available therapeutic options for pruritus in patients with chronic kidney disease and those receiving dialysis. Optimal care requires proper awareness of the severity of symptoms, the impact on quality of life, and the possible long-term outcomes. Optimizing dialysis prescription and correcting electrolyte abnormalities are important treatment targets. A wide range of therapeutic options is also available although none are well-studied in children. An earlier recognition of this debilitating symptom in children and treatment is imperative. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.","['Hemodialysis', 'Kidney failure', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Pruritus', 'Visual analog scale']","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2023-05-12,"[{'lastname': 'Shah', 'firstname': 'Shweta', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA. ssshah@texaschildrens.org.""}, {'lastname': 'Onugha', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Swartz', 'firstname': 'Sarah J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': ""Texas Children's Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.""}]",None,None,None,"© 2023.

34974651",Shared decision-making intervention regarding dialysis modality in patients with CKD stage 5.,"Patients with kidney failure must make complicated decisions about the dialysis modalities used either at home or in-hospital. Different options have varying levels of impact on patients' physical and psychological conditions and their social life. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the implementation of an intervention designed to achieve shared decision making (SDM) in patients' options for dialysis.
SDM was performed after consent was written for stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients before dialysis, and 435 cases were performed in 408 patients from December 16, 2019 to June 30, 2021. Among these, 101 patients were compared by SDM measurement scale, patient satisfaction, disease recognition scale survey, and dialysis method.
The average age of participants was 56 years, with a gender composition of 55 males (54.5%) and 46 females (45.5%). Following SDM, the final dialysis methods decided upon by patients and clinicians were peritoneal dialysis (67 patients, 66.3%), hemodialysis (22 patients, 21.8%), and kidney transplantation (1 patient, 1.0%).
Among participating patients, SDM was effective when used to decide on dialysis treatment, and patients were satisfied with the dialysis method decision process. On the disease awareness scale, those who participated in this project had relatively high positive and low negative perceptions, so it can be concluded that SDM was relatively effective. The implementation of SDM was helpful in selecting patients' best dialysis methods, and SDM scale results were higher in the peritoneal dialysis group than in the hemodialysis group.",[],Medicine,2023-05-12,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Young-Ki', 'initials': 'YK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Yang-Hyeon', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'Renal Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Gospel Hospital, Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea.\nTransplantation Research Institute, Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Do-Hyoung', 'initials': 'DH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kangnam Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jin-Heog', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bigdata and Applied Statistics, College of Science and Technology, Dongguk University, Gyeongju, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jeong-Hwan', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Ji Hyeon', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, National Police Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Ko', 'firstname': 'Gang-Jee', 'initials': 'GJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Hwang', 'firstname': 'Won-Min', 'initials': 'WM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Konyang University Hospital, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Gil', 'firstname': 'Hyo-Wook', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': 'Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital, Cheonan, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Young-Sun', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'Korea University Ansan Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jin', 'firstname': 'Kyu-Bok', 'initials': 'KB', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Keimyung University Dongsan Hospital, Keimyung University Kidney Institute, Keimyung University School of Medicine, Daegu, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Do', 'firstname': 'Jun-Young', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Yeungnam University Hospital, Daegu, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Se-Joong', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Beom-Seok', 'initials': 'BS', 'affiliation': 'Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Ho Sik', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Renal Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Gospel Hospital, Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea.\nTransplantation Research Institute, Kosin University College of Medicine, Busan, South Korea.'}]",None,None,"The average age of participants was 56 years, with a gender composition of 55 males (54.5%) and 46 females (45.5%).

29747386","The Relationship Between Serum Selenium Level, Cognitive Functions, and Depression in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.","Introduction Impairment of cognitive functions can commonly develop in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and increase morbidity and mortality. The antioxidant activity of selenium reduces cognitive decline by protecting neurons from free radical damage. We aimed to explore the associations between serum selenium levels, cognitive impairment, and depression in CKD patients in this research. Methods In this prospective cross-sectional research, 100 participants between the ages of 20 and 65 were included, and four groups of 25 patients each were formed (control group, stage 3-4 CKD, peritoneal dialysis [PD], hemodialysis [HD]). The Standardized Mini Mental Test (sMMT) was used to measure cognitive skills, and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was utilized to diagnose depression. Simultaneously, measurements of serum selenium levels were done from collected blood samples. Results Cognitive impairment was detected in 4% of the control group, 16% of CKD patients (n=75), and 30% of the dialysis patients (n=50). Depression was found in 16% of the control group, 40% of the stage 3-4 CKD group, 50% of the PD group, and 44% of the HD group. In the control group, sMMT scores were higher than the other groups (p<0.001 for all), while the BDI score was statistically significantly lower (p=0.003). Serum selenium levels were found to be higher than HD and PD groups in patients with non-dialysis CKD and control groups in the post hoc analyses (p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). Conclusion Depression and cognitive impairment are particularly prevalent in CKD and dialysis patients. Our results indicate serum selenium insufficiency may be related to depression and cognitive impairment in this patient group. Nonetheless, these findings need to be confirmed by larger-scale studies.","['chronic kidney disease', 'cognitive impairment', 'depression', 'dialysis', 'selenium']",Cureus,2023-05-12,"[{'lastname': 'Tutan', 'firstname': 'Duygu', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Erol Olçok Research and Training Hospital, Çorum, TUR.'}, {'lastname': 'Eser', 'firstname': 'Barış', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hitit University Faculty of Medicine, Çorum, TUR.'}, {'lastname': 'Dogan', 'firstname': 'Ibrahim', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hitit University Faculty of Medicine, Çorum, TUR.'}, {'lastname': 'Aydemir', 'firstname': 'Nihal', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hitit University Faculty of Medicine, Çorum, TUR.'}, {'lastname': 'Kayadibi', 'firstname': 'Huseyin', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, Eskişehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine, Eskişehir, TUR.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2023, Tutan et al.",10.7759/cureus.37233,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x16ed21a30>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,37168193,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37168193,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

30575128","Comparison of quality of life in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease undergoing haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and conservative management in Johannesburg, South Africa: a cross-sectional, descriptive study.","Mental health and quality of life are under-appreciated clinical targets which affect patient and modality survival. Lack of dialysis availability in the resource-constrained public health sector in South Africa results in assignment to treatment modalities without regard to effects on these parameters. We assessed the effect of dialysis modality, demographic and laboratory parameters on mental health and quality of life measurements.
Size-matched cohorts were recruited from patients on haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and patients on conservative management (CM) between September 2020 and March 2021. Responses to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 36 (KDQOL-SF36) questionnaires and demographic and baseline laboratory parameters were compared between modalities. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate independent effect of baseline characteristics on HADS and KDQOL-SF36 scores between treatment groups where significant difference was observed.
Anxiety, depression, and reduced KDQOL measures were widespread amongst respondents. Dialyzed patients reported higher anxiety and depression scores than those on CM (p = 0.040 and p = 0.028). Physical composite (PCS), role-physical (RP), vitality (VS), and emotional well-being (EWB) KDQOL-SF36 scores were poorer in dialyzed patients (p < 0.001 for all). PCS (p = 0.005), pain (p = 0.030), vitality (p = 0.005), and social functioning KDQOL scores were poorer in PD compared to HD; HADS anxiety (p < 0.001) and KDQOL-SF36 EWB scores (p < 0.001) were better in PD. PD patients were more likely to be employed (p = 0.008). Increasing haemoglobin concentration reduced anxiety (p < 0.001) and depression scores (p = 0.004), and improved PCS (p < 0.001), and pain scores (p < 0.001). Higher serum albumin improved PCS (p < 0.001) and vitality (p < 0.001) scores.
Advanced chronic kidney disease increases anxiety and depression and limits quality of life. PD improves mental health and emotional wellbeing and preserves the ability to undertake economic activity but limits social functioning and causes greater physical discomfort. Targeting haemoglobin may ameliorate modality effects on mental health and quality of life.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Haemodialysis', 'Health related quality of life', 'Peritoneal dialysis']",BMC psychology,2023-05-09,"[{'lastname': 'Mathew', 'firstname': 'Neelu', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Davies', 'firstname': 'Malcolm', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.\nDivision of Nephrology, Helen Joseph Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaldine', 'firstname': 'Feroza', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa.\nDepartment of Psychology, Helen Joseph Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Cassimjee', 'firstname': 'Zaheera', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. zaheeracassimjee@gmail.com.\nDivision of Nephrology, Helen Joseph Hospital, Johannesburg, South Africa. zaheeracassimjee@gmail.com.'}]",None,Advanced chronic kidney disease increases anxiety and depression and limits quality of life.

12,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,37150026,Global coagulation assays in patients with chronic kidney disease and their role in predicting thrombotic risk.,"Despite cardiovascular diseases and thrombosis being major causes of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), there remains no effective biomarker to predict thrombotic risk in this population.
To evaluate global coagulation assays in patients with CKD and correlate the biomarkers to clinical outcomes.
Patients with eGFR<30 mL/min/1.73m
Following adjustment for age and gender, CKD subjects (mean age 66 years, 36 % female) had increased maximum amplitude on thromboelastography (70.1 vs 60.2 mm, p < 0.001), higher peak thrombin (233.2 vs 219.7 mm, p = 0.030) and increased OHP (16.1 vs 6.4 units, p < 0.001) compared to healthy controls (n = 153). TFPI was also increased in CKD patients (36.4 vs 14.5 ng/mL, p < 0.001). Compared to hemodialysis patients (n = 43), peritoneal-dialysis patients (n = 25) had more hypercoagulable parameters. Thirty-five CKD patients reported thrombotic complications - key predictors included dialysis, higher fibrinogen, reduced endogenous thrombin potential, elevated D-dimer and increased TFPI. Using the dialysis cohort, the predictive risk model based on the key predictors performed better than Framingham heart score and number of cardiovascular risk factors (Harrell's C-stat 0.862 vs 0.585 vs 0.565).
CKD appears to confer a hypercoagulable state compared to healthy controls. Interestingly, reduced thrombin generation and raised TFPI was paradoxically associated with increased thrombotic risks, highlighting possible complex compensatory mechanisms within the coagulation system, which may be important in predicting clinical outcomes.","['Cardiovascular diseases', 'Chronic renal insufficiency', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Hemostasis', 'Thrombin']",Thrombosis research,2023-05-08,"[{'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Hui Yin', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': 'Northern Clinical Pathology, Thrombosis & Radiology (NECTAR) Research Group, Northern Pathology Victoria, Northern Health, Epping, VIC, Australia; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Northern Health, Epping, VIC, Australia; Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Austin Health, Heidelberg, VIC, Australia; Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

18596117",Progression of Vascular Calcification and Clinical Outcomes in Patients Receiving Maintenance Dialysis.,"Baseline findings from the China Dialysis Calcification Study (CDCS) revealed a high prevalence of vascular calcification (VC) among patients with end-stage kidney disease; however, data on VC progression were limited.
To understand the progression of VC at different anatomical sites, identify risk factors for VC progression, and assess the association of VC progression with the risk of cardiovascular events and death among patients receiving maintenance dialysis.
This cohort study was a 4-year follow-up assessment of participants in the CDCS, a nationwide multicenter prospective cohort study involving patients aged 18 to 74 years who were undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Participants were recruited from 24 centers across China between May 1, 2014, and April 30, 2015, and followed up for 4 years. A total of 1489 patients receiving maintenance dialysis were included in the current analysis. Data were analyzed from September 1 to December 31, 2021.
Patient demographic characteristics and medical history; high-sensitivity C-reactive protein laboratory values; serum calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) values; and previous or concomitant use of medications.
The primary outcome was progression of VC at 3 different anatomical sites (coronary artery, abdominal aorta, and cardiac valves) and identification of risk factors for VC progression. Participants received assessments of coronary artery calcification (CAC), abdominal aortic calcification (AAC), and cardiac valve calcification (CVC) at baseline, 24 months, 36 months, and 48 months. Secondary outcomes included (1) the association between VC progression and the risk of all-cause death, cardiovascular (CV)-related death, and a composite of all-cause death and nonfatal CV events and (2) the association between achievement of serum calcium, phosphorus, and iPTH target levels and the risk of VC progression.
Among 1489 patients, the median (IQR) age was 51.0 (41.0-60.0) years; 59.5% of patients were male. By the end of 4-year follow-up, progression of total VC was observed in 86.5% of patients; 69.6% of patients had CAC progression, 72.4% had AAC progression, and 33.4% had CVC progression. Common risk factors for VC progression at the 3 different anatomical sites were older age and higher fibroblast growth factor 23 levels. Progression of CAC was associated with a higher risk of all-cause death (model 1 [adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index]: hazard ratio [HR], 1.97 [95% CI, 1.16-3.33]; model 2 [adjusted for all factors in model 1 plus smoking status, history of diabetes, and mean arterial pressure]: HR, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.11-3.21]; model 3 [adjusted for all factors in model 2 plus calcium, phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, and fibroblast growth factor 23 levels and calcium-based phosphate binder use]: HR, 1.92 [95% CI, 1.11-3.31]) and the composite of all-cause death and nonfatal CV events (model 1: HR, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.19-3.31]; model 2: HR, 1.91 [95% CI, 1.14-3.21]; model 3: HR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.14-3.33]) after adjusting for all confounding factors except the presence of baseline calcification. Among the 3 targets of calcium, phosphorus, and iPTH, patients who achieved no target levels (model 1: odds ratio [OR], 4.75 [95% CI, 2.65-8.52]; model 2: OR, 4.81 [95% CI, 2.67-8.66]; model 3 [for this analysis, adjusted for all factors in model 2 plus fibroblast growth factor 23 level and calcium-based phosphate binder use]: OR, 2.76 [95% CI, 1.48-5.16]), 1 target level (model 1: OR, 3.71 [95% CI, 2.35-5.88]; model 2: OR, 3.62 [95% CI, 2.26-5.78]; model 3: OR, 2.19 [95% CI, 1.33-3.61]), or 2 target levels (model 1: OR, 2.73 [95% CI, 1.74-4.26]; model 2: OR, 2.69 [95% CI, 1.71-4.25]; model 3: OR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.06-2.79]) had higher odds of CAC progression compared with patients who achieved all 3 target levels.
In this study, VC progressed rapidly in patients undergoing dialysis, with different VC types associated with different rates of prevalence and progression. Consistent achievement of serum calcium, phosphorus, and iPTH target levels was associated with a lower risk of CAC progression. These results may be useful for increasing patient awareness and developing appropriate strategies to improve the management of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder among patients undergoing dialysis.",[],JAMA network open,2023-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Haitao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Diseases, Jinling

22512756",Unraveling the Secrets Behind the Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis Treatment Outcome in Chronic Renal Failure Patients Requiring Hemodialysis: A Systematic Review.,"Multidrug-resistant/rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR TB) is a global concern, with 450,000 new cases and 191,000 deaths in 2021. TB and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been associated since 1974, with suggested explanations such as oxidative stress, malnutrition, dysfunction in vitamin D metabolism, and a compromised cell-mediated immune response. End-stage renal failure patients are more likely to acquire drug resistance due to poor adherence, adverse drug reactions, and inappropriate dose adjustment. We then aim to evaluate the therapeutic outcome of multidrug-resistant TB of the lungs in patients who require hemodialysis in terms of successful treatment (cured and treatment completed) and the associated factors for a favorable outcome. Our secondary goal is to identify unfavorable treatment outcomes (treatment failed, patient died, or patient lost to follow-up) and the underlying associated factors. We conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 Guidelines for this systematic review. We included adults (>19 years old) with chronic kidney disease who needed hemodialysis and had microbiologically confirmed multidrug-resistant pulmonary TB, excluding patients who had a renal allograft transplant, were on peritoneal dialysis, had extrapulmonary TB, were children and pregnant patients. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, PubMed Central, ScienceDirect, Public Library of Science (PLOS), and Google Scholar. Keywords were combined with the Boolean ""AND"" operator to gather results as well as the medical subject heading (MeSH) search strategy. After screening study articles by reading their titles and abstracts, the following tools were used to assess the risk of bias: the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies, the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist for systematic reviews, and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) assessment tool for case reports. Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed, and a conclusion was made. We gathered 21,570 studies from the databases between 2013 and 2023, with 30,062 total participants. There were eight eligible studies for review. Patients with CKD, particularly those on dialysis, are at increased risk of TB due to a combination of factors that contribute to immunosuppression. TB reactivation is common in chronic renal failure patients. Diagnostic samples such as sputum and pleural fluid had lower sensitivity rates compared to tissue samples, which led to delays in diagnosis and treatment and, most importantly, contributed to drug resistance. All new dialysis patients should undergo interferon-gamma release assay testing. TB-infected patients with severe renal disease (eGFR 30 ml/min) had increased morbidity and mortality; however, the use of directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS), and renal-dose adjustment of anti-TB medications significantly reduced these risks. Drug-induced hepatitis and cutaneous reactions were common adverse effects of anti-TB medications. A therapeutic drug monitoring guideline is required to reduce these adverse events and even mortality. Additional research is required to assess the safety and efficacy of therapeutic regimens, as well as their outcomes, in this population with multidrug-resistant TB.","['chronic kidney disease', 'multidrug-resistant pulmonary tb', 'mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'pulmonary tuberculosis', 'renal failure', 'treatment outcome']",Cureus,2023-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hernandez', 'firstname': 'Grethel N', 'initials': 'GN', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Seffah', 'firstname': 'Kofi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.\nInternal Medicine, Piedmont Athens Regional, Athens, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zaman', 'firstname': 'Mustafa Abrar', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': ""Internal Medicine, St. George's University School of Medicine, Newcastle upon Tyne, GBR.\nInternal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Awais', 'firstname': 'Nimra', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Research, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Satnarine', 'firstname': 'Travis', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Pediatrics, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Haq', 'firstname': 'Ayesha', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Deepkumar', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Neurology, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gutlapalli', 'firstname': 'Sai Dheeraj', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine, Richmond University Medical Center, Staten Island, USA.\nInternal Medicine Clinical Research, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahmed', 'firstname': 'Areeg', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Khan', 'firstname': 'Safeera', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine, California Institute of Behavioral Neurosciences & Psychology, Fairfield, USA.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2023, Hernandez et al.",10.7759/cureus.36833,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17e21f2e0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,37123717,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37123717,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

23098343","The association of hepcidin, reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent and anemia-related indicators on anemia in chronic kidney disease.","Hepcidin is an essential regulator of iron homeostasis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) anemia, reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent (RET-He) can be used to evaluate the availability of iron for erythropoiesis. Previous research has found that hepcidin indirectly regulates RET-He. This study aimed to investigate the association of hepcidin, RET-He and anemia-related indicators on anemia in chronic kidney disease. A total of 230 individuals were recruited, including 40 CKD3-4 patients, 70 CKD5 patients without renal replacement therapy, 50 peritoneal dialysis patients, and 70 hemodialysis patients. The serum levels of hemoglobin (Hb), reticulocyte, RET-He, serum iron, serum creatinine, serum ferritin, total iron binding capacity, hepcidin-25, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, transferrin, erythropoietin, intrinsic factor antibody, soluble transferrin receptor and interleukins-6 (IL-6) were measured. Hepcidin-25 was positively associated with IL-6, and negatively with total iron binding capacity, intrinsic factor antibody, and transferrin. Reticulocyte Hb equivalent was associated positively with Hb, serum ferritin, serum iron, transferrin saturation, and negatively with serum creatinine, reticulocyte, IL-6, STfR. Hepcidin-25 was not associated with RET-He, while IL-6 was independently associated with hepcidin-25 and RET-He, suggesting that hepcidin has no effffect on the iron dynamics of reticulocytes in CKD, may be related to IL-6, indicate a likelihood of a threshold for stimulation of hepcidin-25 expression by IL-6 in order to indirectly regulates RET-He.",[],Medicine,2023-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Zhaoli', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University (Qingdao), Qingdao, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Yingying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Yanxia', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University (Qingdao), Qingdao, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Xiaotian', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine Experimental Center, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University (Qingdao), Qingdao, Shandong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Zhao', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2023 the Author(s).

34962074",Safety and Efficacy of Imeglimin for Type 2 Diabetes in Patients Undergoing Dialysis.,"Imeglimin is a novel small molecular tetrahydrotriazine that has been shown to improve hyperglycemia in clinical trials among patients with type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, its pharmacokinetics in patients with renal dysfunction remain unclear. The objective of this study was to elucidate the safety and effects of imeglimin in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing dialysis.
Six patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) received imeglimin 500 mg/day. The observation period was 3.3±2.3 months.
Fasting blood glucose was significantly decreased, compared to baseline after imeglimin treatment (126.2±32.0 mg/dl, p=0.037, vs. baseline). Furthermore, levels of alanine aminotransferase were decreased (10.3±6.3 IU/l, p=0.006, vs. baseline). Glycated hemoglobin A1c and triglyceride tended to be decreased, albeit without statistical significance. Levels of total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and aspartate aminotransferase were not changed compared to baseline values.
Despite the small sample size, imeglimin was found to be an effective and relatively well-tolerated agent for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing both HD and PD. During the observation period, adverse events such as hypoglycemia, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting were not recognized in any patient.","['CKD', 'ESRD', 'Imeglimin', 'chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'end-stage renal disease', 'type 2 diabetes']","In vivo (Athens, Greece)",2023-04-27,"[{'lastname': 'Mima', 'firstname': 'Akira', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Osaka Medical and Pharmaceutical University, Osaka, Japan akira.mima@ompu.ac.jp.'}]",None,"Despite the small sample size, imeglimin was found to be an effective and relatively well-tolerated agent for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing both HD and PD.

19,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,37098669,Shared Decision Making for Choosing renAl Replacement Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients (SDM-ART trial): study protocol for randomized clinical trial.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be educated about their condition so that they can initiate dialysis at the optimal time and make an informed choice between dialysis modalities. Shared decision-making (SDM) empowers patients to select their own treatment and improves patient outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate whether SDM affects the choice of renal replacement therapy among CKD patients.
This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, pragmatic clinical trial. A total of 1,194 participants with CKD who are considering renal replacement therapy were enrolled. The participants will be randomized into three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: the conventional group, extensive informed decision-making group, and SDM group. Participants will be educated twice at months 0 and 2. Videos and leaflets will be provided to all patients. Patients in the conventional group will receive 5 minutes of education at each visit. The extensive informed decision-making group will receive more informed and detailed education using intensive learning materials for 10 minutes each visit. Patients in the SDM group will be educated for 10 minutes each visit according to illness perception and item-based analysis. The primary endpoint is the ratio of hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation among the groups. Secondary outcomes include unplanned dialysis, economic efficiency, patient satisfaction, patient evaluation of the process, and patient adherence.
The SDM-ART is an ongoing clinical study to investigate the effect of SDM on the choice of renal replacement therapy in patients with CKD.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Hemodialysis', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Shared decision making']",Kidney research and clinical practice,2023-04-26,"[{'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Jae Hyun', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Yong Chul', 'initials': 'YC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Sang Heon', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine and BioMedical Research Institute, Pusan National University Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Busan, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Soojin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Communication and Media, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jo', 'firstname': 'Min-Woo', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Sejoong', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,10.23876/j.krcp.22.019,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17e269ee0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,37098669,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37098669,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

26287983",Interventions for dialysis patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on dialysis, causes chronic liver disease, may increase the risk of death, and impacts kidney transplant outcomes. Direct-acting antivirals have replaced interferons because of better efficacy and tolerability. This is an update of a review first published in 2015.
We aimed to look at the benefits and harms of interventions for HCV in CKD patients on dialysis: death, disease relapse, treatment response/discontinuation, time to recovery, quality of life (QoL), cost-effectiveness, and adverse events. We aimed to study comparisons of available interventions, compared with placebo, control, with each other and with newer treatments.
We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 23 February 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, handsearching conference proceedings, and searching the International Clinical Trials Register Portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, first period of randomised cross-over studies on interventions for HCV in CKD on dialysis were considered.
Summary estimates of effect were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
Three studies were included in this update, therefore 13 studies (997 randomised participants) met our inclusion criteria. Overall, the risk of bias was judged low in seven studies, unclear in four, low to unclear in one, and high in one study. Interventions included standard interferon, pegylated (PEG) interferon, standard or PEG interferon plus ribavirin; direct-acting antivirals, and direct-acting antivirals plus PEG interferon plus ribavirin. Compared to placebo or control, standard interferon may make little or no difference to death (5 studies, 134 participants: RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.06 to 13.23) or relapse (low certainty evidence), probably improves end-of-treatment response (ETR) (5 studies, 132 participants: RR 8.62, 95% CI 3.03 to 24.55; I² = 0%) (moderate certainty evidence), and probably makes little or no difference to sustained virological response (SVR) (4 studies, 98 participants: RR 3.25, 95% CI 0.81 to 13.07; I² = 53%), treatment discontinuation (4 studies, 116 participants: RR 4.59, 95% CI 0.49 to 42.69; I² = 63%), and adverse events (5 studies, 143 participants: RR 3.56, 95% CI 0.98 to 13.01; I² = 25%) (moderate certainty evidence). In low certainty evidence, PEG interferon (1 study, 50 participants) may improve ETR (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.15) but may make little or no difference to death (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.81), SVR (RR 2.40, 95% CI 0.99 to 5.81), treatment discontinuation (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.96), adverse events (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.96) and relapses (21/38 relapsed) (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.25) compared to standard interferon. In moderate certainty evidence, high-dose PEG interferon (alpha-2a and alpha-2b) may make little or no difference to death (2 studies, 97 participants: RR 4.30, 95% CI 0.76 to 24.33; I² = 0%), ETR (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.90; I² = 20%), SVR (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.07; I² = 0%), treatment discontinuation (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.28; I² = 0%) or adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.83; I² = 27%) compared to low-dose PEG interferon. High-dose PEG interferon may make little or no difference to relapses (1 study, 43 participants: RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.77; low certainty evidence). There were no significant subgroup differences. Standard interferon plus ribavirin may lead to higher treatment discontinuation (1 study, 52 participants: RR 2.97, 95% CI 1.19 to 7.36; low certainty evidence) compared to standard interferon alone.  In low certainty evidence, PEG interferon plus ribavirin (1 study, 377 participants) may improve SVR (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.21), reduce relapses (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.48), slightly increase the number with adverse events (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.19), and may make little or no difference to ETR (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09) compared to PEG interferon alone. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of PEG interferon plus ribavirin on treatment discontinuation (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.69 to 4.24) compared to PEG interferon alone. One study reported grazoprevir plus elbasvir improved ETR (173 participants: RR 174.99, 95% CI 11.03 to 2775.78; low certainty evidence) compared to placebo. It is uncertain whether telaprevir plus ribavirin (high versus low initial dose) plus PEG interferon for 24 versus 48 weeks (1 study, 35 participants) improves ETR (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.56) or SVR (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.56) because the certainty of the evidence is very low.  Data on QoL, cost-effectiveness, cardiovascular outcomes and peritoneal dialysis were not available.
In dialysis patients with HCV infection grazoprevir plus elbasvir probably improves ETR. There is no difference in ETR or SVR for combinations of telaprevir, ribavirin and PEG interferon given for different durations and doses. Though no longer in use, PEG interferon was more effective than standard interferon for ETR but not SVR. Increasing doses of PEG interferon did not improve responses. The addition of ribavirin to PEG interferon may result in fewer relapses, higher SVR, and higher numbers with adverse events.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2023-04-25,"[{'lastname': 'Prabhu', 'firstname': 'Attur Ravindra', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Kasturba Medical College Manipal, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Rao', 'firstname': 'Indu Ramachandra', 'initials': 'IR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Kasturba Medical College Manipal, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Nagaraju', 'firstname': 'Shankar Prasad', 'initials': 'SP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Kasturba Medical College Manipal, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Rajwar', 'firstname': 'Eti', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Public Health Evidence South Asia (PHESA), Prasanna School of Public Health, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Venkatesh', 'firstname': 'Bhumika T', 'initials': 'BT', 'affiliation': 'Public Health Evidence South Asia (PHESA), Prasanna School of Public Health, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Nair N', 'firstname': 'Sreekumaran', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Biometrics & Informatics (Biostatistics), Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) (Institution of National Importance Under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India), Dhanvantri Nagar, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Pai', 'firstname': 'Ganesh', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, Kasturba Medical College Manipal, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Reddy', 'firstname': 'Nageswara P', 'initials': 'NP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Yashoda Hospitals, Hyderabad, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Suvarna', 'firstname': 'Deepak', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gastroenterology, JSS Medical College, Mysore, India.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2023 The Cochrane Collaboration.

21,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,37096396,Vadadustat for treatment of anemia in patients with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease receiving peritoneal dialysis.,"Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors such as vadadustat may provide an oral alternative to injectable erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for treating anemia in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. In two randomized (1:1), global, phase 3, open-label, sponsor-blind, parallel-group, active-controlled noninferiority trials in patients with dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (INNO2VATE), vadadustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alfa with respect to cardiovascular safety and hematological efficacy. Vadadustat's effects in patients receiving only peritoneal dialysis is unclear.
We conducted a post hoc analysis of patients in the INNO2VATE trials receiving peritoneal dialysis at baseline. The prespecified primary safety endpoint was time to first major cardiovascular event (MACE; defined as all-cause mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke). The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in hemoglobin from baseline to the primary efficacy period (weeks 24-36).
Of the 3923 patients randomized in the two INNO2VATE trials, 309 were receiving peritoneal dialysis (vadadustat, n = 152; darbepoetin alfa, n = 157) at baseline. Time to first MACE was similar in the vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa groups (hazard ratio 1.10; 95% CI 0.62, 1.93). In patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, the difference in mean change in hemoglobin concentrations was -0.10 g/dL (95% CI -0.33, 0.12) in the primary efficacy period. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was 88.2% versus 95.5%, and serious TEAEs was 52.6% versus 73.2% in the vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa groups, respectively.
In the subgroup of patients receiving peritoneal dialysis in the phase 3 INNO2VATE trials, safety and efficacy of vadadustat were similar to darbepoetin alfa.","['anemia', 'chronic kidney disease', 'hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'vadadustat']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2023-04-25,"[{'lastname': 'Sarnak', 'firstname': 'Mark J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Tufts Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Agarwal', 'firstname': 'Rajiv', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Boudville', 'firstname': 'Neil', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Medical School, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chowdhury', 'firstname': 'Pradip C P', 'initials': 'PCP', 'affiliation': 'Peritoneal Dialysis Center of America, Montebello, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Eckardt', 'firstname': 'Kai-Uwe', 'initials': 'KU', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Medical Intensive Care, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gonzalez', 'firstname': 'Carlos R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'PI Health, Montebello, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kooienga', 'firstname': 'Laura A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Colorado Kidney Care, Denver, CO, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Koury', 'firstname': 'Mark J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ntoso', 'firstname': 'Kwabena A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Pennsylvania Nephrology Associates, Philadelphia, PA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Wenli', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Akebia Therapeutics, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Parfrey', 'firstname': 'Patrick S', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': ""Memorial University, St. John's, NL, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Vargo', 'firstname': 'Dennis L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Akebia Therapeutics, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Winkelmayer', 'firstname': 'Wolfgang C', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Zhiqun', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Akebia Therapeutics, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chertow', 'firstname': 'Glenn M', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.'}]",None,None,"Of the 3923 patients randomized in the two INNO2VATE trials, 309 were receiving peritoneal dialysis (vadadustat, n = 152; darbepoetin alfa, n = 157) at baseline.

22,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,37070916,Screening of Fabry Disease of patients in renal replacement therapy in a population from Lazio (Italy).,"Fabry's disease (FD) is a genetic disorder of lysosomal storage characterized by the intralysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). This genetic mutation causes a total or partial deficit of the α-galactosidase (GAL) enzyme activity. FD has an incidence of 1:40000-60000 born alive. Its prevalence is higher in specific pathological conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the FD prevalence in Italian renal replacement therapy (RRT) patients from Lazio region.
485 patients in RRT (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation) were recruited. The screening test was performed on venous blood sample. The latter was analyzed using specific FD diagnostic kit, based on the analysis of dried blood spots on filter paper.
We found 3 cases of positivity to FD (1 female and 2 males). In addition, 1 male patient was identified with biochemical alteration indicative of GAL enzyme deficiency with a genetic variant of the GLA gene of unknown clinical significance. The FD prevalence in our population was 0.60% (1 case out 163), it rises to 0.80% (1 case out of 122) if the genetic variant of unknown clinical significance is considered. Comparing the three subpopulations, we observed a statistically significant difference in GAL activity in transplanted patients compared to dialysis patients (p<0.001).
Considering the presence of an enzyme replacement therapy able to modify FD clinical history, it is essential to try to implement FD early diagnoses. However, the screening is too expensive to be extended on large scale, due to the low prevalence of the pathology. The screening should be performed on high-risk populations.",[],European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,2023-04-19,"[{'lastname': 'Marrone', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. annalisa.noce@uniroma2.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Angelico', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Di Lauro', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sargentini', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Manzia', 'firstname': 'T M', 'initials': 'TM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tisone', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Mitterhofer', 'firstname': 'A P', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Della Morte Canosci', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tesauro', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Di Daniele', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Noce', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,"We found 3 cases of positivity to FD (1 female and 2 males).

20338463",The benefit of planned dialysis to early survival on hemodialysis versus peritoneal dialysis: a nationwide prospective multicenter study in Korea.,"Optimal preparation is recommended for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease to minimize complications during dialysis initiation. This study evaluated the effects of planned dialysis initiation on survival in patients undergoing incident hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Patients newly diagnosed with end-stage kidney disease who started dialysis were enrolled in a multicenter prospective cohort study in Korea. Planned dialysis was defined as dialysis therapy initiated with permanent access and maintenance of the initial dialysis modality. A total of 2892 patients were followed up for a mean duration of 71.9 ± 36.7 months and 1280 (44.3%) patients initiated planned dialysis. The planned dialysis group showed lower mortality than the unplanned dialysis group during the 1st and 2nd years after dialysis initiation (1st year: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.72; P < 0.001; 2nd year: aHR 0.71; 95% CI 0.52-0.98, P = 0.037). However, 2 years after dialysis initiation, mortality did not differ between the groups. Planned dialysis showed a better early survival rate in hemodialysis patients, but not in peritoneal dialysis patients. Particularly, infection-related mortality was reduced only in patients undergoing hemodialysis with planned dialysis initiation. Planned dialysis has survival benefits over unplanned dialysis in the first 2 years after dialysis initiation, especially in patients undergoing hemodialysis. It improved infection-related mortality during the early dialysis period.",[],Scientific reports,2023-04-14,"[{'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Jeong-Hoon', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu, 41944, South Korea.\nClinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Ji Hye', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu, 41944, South Korea.\nClinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jeon', 'firstname': 'Yena', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.\nDepartment of Statistics, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Yon Su', 'initials': 'YS', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Shin-Wook', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Chul Woo', 'initials': 'CW', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Nam-Ho', 'initials': 'NH', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Jung', 'firstname': 'Hee-Yeon', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu, 41944, South Korea.\nClinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Ji-Young', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu, 41944, South Korea.\nClinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Sun-Hee', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu, 41944, South Korea.\nClinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Chan-Duck', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu, 41944, South Korea.\nClinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Yong-Lim', 'initials': 'YL', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu, 41944, South Korea. ylkim@knu.ac.kr.\nClinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea. ylkim@knu.ac.kr.'}, {'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Jang-Hee', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Kyungpook National University Hospital, 130 Dongdeok-ro, Jung-gu, Daegu, 41944, South Korea. jh-cho@knu.ac.kr.\nClinical Research Center for End Stage Renal Disease, Daegu, South Korea. jh-cho@knu.ac.kr.'}]",None,None,None,© 2023.

33123354","Relationship between lipoprotein(a) levels, cardiovascular outcomes and death in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review of prospective studies.","In the general population, high levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) are an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, the information available in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less robust. The main objective of this updated systematic review of prospective studies was to analyze the association between elevated Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular outcomes or death in patients with CKD.
The PRISMA guidelines were used to carry out this systematic review. Randomized clinical trials or prospective observational studies that evaluated the association between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular outcomes or death in CKD patients were searched in the current literature.
Fifteen studies including 12,260 individuals were identified and considered eligible for this systematic review. In total, 14 prospective cohorts and one post-hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial were analyzed. Eight studies evaluated hemodialysis patients, one study analyzed patients on peritoneal dialysis, while six studies evaluated subjects with different stages of CKD. Median follow-up duration ranged from 1 to 8.6 years. Our findings showed that elevated Lp(a) values were associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events or death in most studies, despite adjusting for traditional risk factors.
The findings of this systematic review show that there is a positive association between Lp(a) levels and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with CKD.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Dyslipidemia', 'Lipoprotein(a)', 'Systematic review']",Journal of nephrology,2023-04-09,"[{'lastname': 'Barbagelata', 'firstname': 'Leandro', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Cardiology Department, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Perón 4190, C1199ABB, Buenos Aires, Argentina. leandro.barbagelata@hospitalitaliano.org.ar.'}, {'lastname': 'Masson', 'firstname': 'Walter', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Cardiology Department, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Perón 4190, C1199ABB, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Corral', 'firstname': 'Pablo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Medicina, Universidad FASTA, Mar del Plata, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Lavalle-Cobo', 'firstname': 'Augusto', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Cardiology Department, Sanatorio Finochieto, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Nogueira', 'firstname': 'Juan Patricio', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Centro de Investigación en Endocrinología, Nutrición y Metabolismo (CIENM), Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Nacional de Formosa, Formosa, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosa Diez', 'firstname': 'Guillermo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}]",None,The findings of this systematic review show that there is a positive association between Lp(a) levels and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with CKD.,"Fifteen studies including 12,260 individuals were identified and considered eligible for this systematic review.

This study described baseline characteristics, adverse clinical event rates, and mortality risk in patients with CKD, accounting for CKD stage and dialysis status.
This retrospective, noninterventional cohort study included data from adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with two consecutive estimated glomerular filtration rates of < 60 ml/min/1.73 m
Overall, 310,953 patients with CKD were included. Comorbidities were more common in patients receiving dialysis than in NDD-CKD, and increased with advancing CKD stage. Rates of adverse clinical events, particularly hyperkalemia and infection/sepsis, also increased with advancing CKD stage and were higher in patients on HD versus PD. Mortality risk during follow-up (1-5-year range) was lowest in patients with stage 3a NDD-CKD (2.0-18.5%) and highest in patients with IDD-CKD (26.3-58.4%).
These findings highlight the need to monitor patients with CKD for comorbidities and complications, as well as signs or symptoms of clinical adverse events.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hyperkalemia', 'Pneumonia', 'Sepsis']",BMC nephrology,2023-04-06,"[{'lastname': 'Little', 'firstname': 'Dustin J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Late Cardiovascular, Renal, Metabolism, BioPharmaceuticals R&D, AstraZeneca, Gaithersburg, MD, 20876, USA.

26,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,37010133,Evaluation of Bach1 mRNA expression in patients with chronic kidney disease: A preliminary study.,"BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1) is a protein that antagonizes some actions of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), the master regulator of cytoprotective responses. Bach1 binds to genomic DNA and inhibits the synthesis of antioxidant enzymes, thereby increasing inflammation. Bach1 may be a therapeutic target for mitigating inflammation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. However, no clinical study has been reported on Bach1 in this population. This study aimed to evaluate Bach1 mRNA expression with different treatments for CKD, including conservative treatment (nondialysis), hemodialysis (HD), and peritoneal dialysis (PD).
Twenty patients undergoing HD (56.5 [19] years), 15 on PD (54 [24] years) and 13 nondialysis patients (63 [10] years, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 41 [14] mL/min/1.73 m
As expected, patients on dialysis were more inflamed. Bach1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in patients undergoing HD than in PD and nondialysis patients (p < 0.007). The mRNA expression of HO-1, NF-kB, and Nrf2 was not different in the groups.
In conclusion, CKD patients on HD exhibited an upregulation of Bach1 mRNA expression compared to patients on PD treatment and nondialysis CKD patients. The association between Nrf2 and Bach1 expression in these patients warrants further investigation.","['BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1)', 'NF-kB', 'Nrf2', 'chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'inflammation']",Hemodialysis international.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of patient empowerment through the PBL model in health continuing education of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
From March 2017 to April 2017, a total of 94 participants were randomly assigned to the PBL group and the traditional group, with 47 patients in each group. Patients of the PBL group were divided into 5 study groups; and six PBL health education activities were held. The basic knowledge, self-management behavior, quality of life, anxiety, and depression were assessed among the traditional group and the PBL group. The average follow-up duration was 10.6±1.5 months.
Compared with patients in the traditional group, patients in the PBL group had higher scores of basic knowledges for PD (84.33±3.55 vs 91.19±3.07; 
The empowerment model of PBL health education can effectively improve the knowledge, skills and quality of life of PD patients.
The findings identified in this study will help to improve the quality of nursing care and health education for PD patients.
The study design involved patients on PD training. The knowledge and skills of PD and quality of life will improve after they participate the PBL health education activities.","['PBL', 'chronic kidney disease', 'patient education', 'patient empowerment', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'quality of life']",Patient preference and adherence,2023-04-04,"[{'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Fang', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Provincial Clinical College, Fujian Medical University, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, 350001, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Hong', 'firstname': 'Fuyuan', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Provincial Clinical College, Fujian Medical University, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, 350001, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Ruan', 'firstname': 'Yiping', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Provincial Clinical College, Fujian Medical University, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, 350001, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Miao', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Provincial Clinical College, Fujian Medical University, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, 350001, People's Republic of China.""}]",None,"The empowerment model of PBL health education can effectively improve the knowledge, skills and quality of life of PD patients.","Compared with patients in the traditional group, patients in the PBL group had higher scores of basic knowledges for PD (84.33±3.55 vs 91.19±3.07; ",© 2023 Cao et al.,"10.2147/PPA.S402698

They can present a diagnostic challenge given the broad range of underlying etiologies. Uremic tumoral calcinosis (UTC) is a rare complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) resulting from metastatic soft tissue calcification. Common sites include periarticular soft tissues of the shoulders, elbows, and hands (Pan and Chen, 2016). UTC can also affect the cervical spine and mimic osteosarcomas (Zhou et al., 2018). We present the case of a 71-year-old female with hypertension, left carotid artery stenosis, mitral valve prolapse, and ESRD secondary to diabetes mellitus type II (DMII) on peritoneal dialysis who was found to have large, heterogeneous, bilateral calcified neck masses. Given her clinical history, laboratory results, and imaging findings, she was diagnosed with UTC. In addition to this case, we provide an overview of tumoral calcinosis (TC) and a differential diagnosis for calcified lesions of the head and neck.","['Calcified lesions', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Dialysis', 'Metastatic calcification', 'Uremic tumoral calcinosis']",American journal of otolaryngology,2023-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jaehee', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, USA.

29,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36999266,Chronic Kidney Disease Care in Indonesia: Challenges and Opportunities.,"The burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant global health concern. Previous study reported that the CKD incidence reached 200 cases per million per year in many countries with the prevalence 11.5% (4.8% in stages 1-2 and 6.7% in stages 3-5). Other study further reported that the estimate prevalence of CKD was 15% higher in low- and middle-income countries compared to the high-income countries. However, there are limited statistics available on the epidemiology of CKD in Indonesia. According to the Basic Health Research (Riset Kesehatan Dasar [Riskesdas], 2018], the prevalence of CKD in Indonesia increased from 0.2% in 2013 to 0.3% in 2018. These results may understate the true prevalence of CKD in our population. Despite the limited data on the CKD prevalence, the number of patients receiving kidney replacement treatment (KRT), primarily in the form of hemodialysis, is rapidly rising (i.e., more than 132.000 in 2018).A comprehensive nephrology referral system is also a challenge. We can argue this statement with evidence from the tertiary care, where it was reported that most kidney failure patients (83%) commenced dialysis with an urgent start, along with late referral to nephrologist (90%), started dialysis with temporary catheter (95.2%), and the median eGFR to start dialysis was 5.3 (range: 0.6 - 14.6) ml/minute/1.73 m2. However, individual awareness, as well as an effective screening and prevention program for high-risk group are also a significant hurdles. Since 2022, the Ministry of Health has initiated a health transformation program to improve the health system, to address health disparities, both within the country and between countries. One of the health transformation programs which specify in nephrology care is the implementation of the Uro-Nephrology Support Program (Program Pengampuan Uro-Nefrologi), with the aim to strengthen services, provide equal distribution of services and increase the latest technology for the diagnosis and treatment of urology/nephrology diseases in Indonesia. This program included secondary and tertiary care to improve the extent and quality of care to slowing the CKD progression, improving kidney replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplant) access and treatment, as well as to provide dialysis training program for health care workers. Providing high-quality nephrology care that all Indonesians can access is challenging. Yet, steps have already been taken in the direction of service enhancement. Thus, there is hope for better kidney health in Indonesia. Governments, academic medical centres, nephrology societies, as well as the citizen will all need to work together and take consistent effort to make a sustainable and comprehensive kidney care.","['Indonesia', 'Nephrology care', 'Prevalence', 'chronic kidney disease']",Acta medica Indonesiana,2023-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Hustrini', 'firstname': 'Ni Made', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Universitas Indonesia - Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. madekum99@gmail.com.'}]",None,None,None,None,None,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x16ec33790>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,36999266,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36999266,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

28848355",Ferric Derisomaltose Evaluation in Patients with Non-Dialysis-Dependent Chronic Kidney Disease or Peritoneal Dialysis.,"Iron deficiency anemia is common in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Ferric derisomaltose (FDI) enables iron repletion in a single dose, unlike other forms of iron for IV administration, which require multiple doses. Protocols are commonly used with other IV irons, but there are limited Canadian data for FDI, and no protocol exists.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of FDI for patients with CKD and to ascertain information related to its use in Canadian provinces.
This retrospective cohort study involved patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) and patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) who received FDI in a tertiary hospital in Nova Scotia between June 2020 and May 2021. Each patient was followed for a minimum of 6 months. The efficacy outcomes were the changes from baseline in hemoglobin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), and ferritin after the first dose of FDI and at 3 and 6 months. The safety outcomes were the frequency and types of adverse reactions to FDI. Electronic surveys were sent to 33 Canadian renal pharmacists to gather information about FDI use, dosing, administration, monitoring, funding, and safety in their respective organizations.
A total of 52 infusions were administered to 35 patients during the study period. The median times between doses 1 and 2 and between doses 2 and 3 were 19.1 and 6.6 weeks, respectively. The median change from baseline to first post-FDI follow-up blood work was significant for hemoglobin (9.0 g/L, 
This study provides evidence that FDI is an effective and safe treatment for anemia in NDD-CKD and PD patients.
L’anémie ferriprive est fréquente chez les patients atteints d’insuffisance rénale chronique avancée (IRC). Une seule dose de dérisomaltose ferrique (FDI) permet au niveau de fer de se rétablir, contrairement à d’autres formes de fer administrées par IV qui nécessitent, elles, plusieurs doses. Des protocoles sont couramment utilisés avec d’autres fers administrés par IV, mais les données canadiennes sur le FDI sont limitées et il n’existe aucun protocole.
Évaluer l’efficacité et l’innocuité du FDI chez les patients atteints d’IRC et vérifier les informations relatives à son utilisation dans les provinces du Canada.
Cette étude de cohorte rétrospective comprenait des patients atteints d’IRC sans dialyse (NDD-IRC) et des patients sous dialyse péritonéale (DP) ayant reçu du FDI dans un hôpital de soins tertiaires de la Nouvelle-Écosse entre juin 2020 et mai 2021. Chaque patient a fait l’objet d’un suivi pendant au moins 6 mois. Les résultats d’efficacité étaient les changements par rapport à la base de trois mesures après la première dose de FDI et à 3 et 6 mois, soit l’hémoglobine, la saturation de la transferrine (TSAT) et la ferritine. Les résultats d’innocuité étaient la fréquence et les types de réactions indésirables au FDI. Des sondages ont été envoyés par voie électronique à 33 pharmaciens canadiens spécialisés en néphrologie afin de recueillir des renseignements sur l’utilisation, le dosage, l’administration, la surveillance, le financement et l’innocuité du FDI dans leurs organismes respectifs.
Au total, 52 perfusions ont été administrées à 35 patients au cours de la période d’étude. Les délais médians entre les doses 1 et 2, et entre les doses 2 et 3 étaient respectivement de 19,1 et 6,6 semaines. Le changement médian entre la base et le premier bilan sanguin de suivi post-FDI était important pour l’hémoglobine (9,0 g/L,

35103481",Novel Aspects of the Immune Response Involved in the Peritoneal Damage in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients under Dialysis.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) incidence is growing worldwide, with a significant percentage of CKD patients reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requiring kidney replacement therapies (KRT). Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a convenient KRT presenting benefices as home therapy. In PD patients, the peritoneum is chronically exposed to PD fluids containing supraphysiologic concentrations of glucose or other osmotic agents, leading to the activation of cellular and molecular processes of damage, including inflammation and fibrosis. Importantly, peritonitis episodes enhance peritoneum inflammation status and accelerate peritoneal injury. Here, we review the role of immune cells in the damage of the peritoneal membrane (PM) by repeated exposure to PD fluids during KRT as well as by bacterial or viral infections. We also discuss the anti-inflammatory properties of current clinical treatments of CKD patients in KRT and their potential effect on preserving PM integrity. Finally, given the current importance of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, we also analyze here the implications of this disease in CKD and KRT.","['COVID-19', 'immune system', 'inflammation', 'kidney', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'peritoneal fibrosis']",International journal of molecular sciences,2023-03-30,"[{'lastname': 'Trionfetti', 'firstname': 'Flavia', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Rome, Italy.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Preclinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, National Institute for Infectious Diseases L., Spallanzani, IRCCS, Via Portuense, 292, 00149 Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Marchant', 'firstname': 'Vanessa', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Cellular Biology in Renal Diseases Laboratory, IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz-Universidad Autónoma Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.\nREDINREN/RICORS2040, 28029 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'González-Mateo', 'firstname': 'Guadalupe T', 'initials': 'GT', 'affiliation': 'Cell-Cell Communication & Inflammation Unit, Centre for Molecular Biology ""Severo Ochoa"" (CSIC-UAM), 28049 Madrid, Spain.\nPremium Research, S.L., 19005 Guadalajara, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Kawka', 'firstname': 'Edyta', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathophysiology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 10 Fredry St., 61-701 Poznan, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Márquez-Expósito', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Cellular Biology in Renal Diseases Laboratory, IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz-Universidad Autónoma Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.\nREDINREN/RICORS2040, 28029 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ortiz', 'firstname': 'Alberto', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz-Universidad Autónoma Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'López-Cabrera', 'firstname': 'Manuel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cell-Cell Communication & Inflammation Unit, Centre for Molecular Biology ""Severo Ochoa"" (CSIC-UAM), 28049 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruiz-Ortega', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cellular Biology in Renal Diseases Laboratory, IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz-Universidad Autónoma Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.\nREDINREN/RICORS2040, 28029 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Strippoli', 'firstname': 'Raffaele', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Rome, Italy.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Preclinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, National Institute for Infectious Diseases L., Spallanzani, IRCCS, Via Portuense, 292, 00149 Rome, Italy.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/ijms24065763

33080082",Adipokines as predictive factor of cardiac function in pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Adipokines are associated with cardiovascular disease; in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients adipokines could be useful prognostic factors.
To explore whether leptin and adiponectin in kidney replacement therapy (KRT) children could have a role on their cardiac function, in the long-term.
Prospective cohort study was performed with pediatric KRT patients, aged 8 to 17 years who were undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. At enrollment, lipid profile, adipokines (leptin, leptin receptor, free leptin, and adiponectin), anthropometric measurements and cardiological evaluation were determined. At two-year follow-up, a new cardiological evaluation was performed. 
We included 56 patients, with a median age of 12.5 years. In the first cardiological evaluation, median LVEF was 70.0% (IQR 61%, 76%), 20 patients (35.7%) had some cardiovascular condition, and 10 (17.8%) altered LVEF. At 24-month follow-up, the median LVEF was 70.5% (IQR 65.1%, 77%), while the delta-LVEF values was 3% (IQR -6.5%, 7%). Delta-LVEF were correlated with baseline adipokines serum levels, and the only positive correlation found was with free leptin (r=0.303, p=0.025). In multivariate analysis, levels of free leptin (Coef. 0.12, p<0.036) and leptin (coef. 1.72, p=0.049), as well as baseline LVEF (Coef. -0.65, p<0.001) were associated with delta-LVEF.
Free leptin, leptin and LVEF at the beginning of follow-up were associated with the LVEF decrease at the 24-month follow-up in KRT children.","['cardiac function', 'chronic kidney disease', 'free leptin', 'leptin', 'pediatric']",Frontiers in endocrinology,2023-03-28,"[{'lastname': 'Villasis-Keever', 'firstname': 'Miguel Angel', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Research Unit in Analysis and Synthesis of the Evidence, National Medical Center XXI Century, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Zurita-Cruz', 'firstname': 'Jessie Nallely', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': 'Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gómez, Facultad de Medicina Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Zepeda-Martinez', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Nephology, Children's Hospital, National Medical Center XXI Century, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.""}, {'lastname': 'Alegria-Torres', 'firstname': 'Gabriela', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Nephology, Children's Hospital, National Medical Center XXI Century, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.""}, {'lastname': 'Serret-Montoya', 'firstname': 'Juana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Adolescent Medicine Service, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gómez, Ministry of Health, Secretaria de Salud (SSA), Mexico City, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Estrada-Loza', 'firstname': 'Maria de Jesus', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Children's Hospital, National Medical Center XXI Century, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.""}, {'lastname': 'Hernández-Hernández', 'firstname': 'Beatriz Carolina', 'initials': 'BC', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Nephology, Children's Hospital, National Medical Center XXI Century, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.""}, {'lastname': 'Alonso-Flores', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Nephology, Children's Hospital, National Medical Center XXI Century, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.""}, {'lastname': 'Zavala-Serret', 'firstname': 'Monica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Adolescent Medicine Service, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gómez, Ministry of Health, Secretaria de Salud (SSA), Mexico City, Mexico.'}]",None,None,"We included 56 patients, with a median age of 12.5 years.

23291474",Prevalence of cognitive impairment in peritoneal dialysis patients and associated factors.,"Cognitive impairment (CI) in patients with chronic kidney disease, including those treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a growing problem worldwide. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of CI and associated factors in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD).
In this cross-sectional study, 18 consecutive patients with PD therapy and 15 controls were evaluated for CI using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE III) test.
The prevalence of CI was 33% in patients and 27% in the control group and was not statistically significant. A higher prevalence of CI was found in subjects aged ≥65 years old than in those <65years old (p = 0.02), but only in the control group. The prevalence of CI in PD patients over and under 65 years of age did not differ statistically significantly (p = 0.12). Memory and verbal fluency were the most affected cognitive domain in PD patients with CI (p = 0.00, p = 0.04, respectively). There was a significant correlation between higher-educated PD patients and the ACE III test results. The duration of dialysis did not affect the results of the cognitive screening test.
Cognitive impairment is a growing problem in the course of chronic kidney disease and dialysis therapy. It seems that cognitive problems may occur in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis at a younger age than in the general population with particularly affected memory and verbal fluency. Higher-educated patients score better on the cognitive screening test.",[],Kidney & blood pressure research,2023-03-21,"[{'lastname': 'Golenia', 'firstname': 'Aleksandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zolek', 'firstname': 'Norbert', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Olejnik', 'firstname': 'Piotr', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wojtaszek', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Glogowski', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Malyszko', 'firstname': 'Jolanta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",None,Cognitive impairment is a growing problem in the course of chronic kidney disease and dialysis therapy.

34,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36934668,The effect of Brazilian Green Propolis extract on inflammation in patients with chronic kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis: A randomised double-blind controlled clinical trial.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients on dialysis display a low-grade systemic inflammatory burden. Nutritional interventions designed to activate the cytoprotective nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and inhibit nuclear factor-kB (NF-κB) have been proposed to mitigate this burden. Several bioactive compounds have been investigated to achieve this, including propolis, a resin produced by Apis mellifera bees. Considering the safety and efficacy of propolis, it could be a strategy to benefit these patients. Still, there are no studies using propolis in patients with CKD on peritoneal dialysis (DP), and clinical studies to support this application are lacking.
The objective and novelty of the present study are to evaluate the effects of propolis supplementation on inflammatory markers in patients with CKD on PD.
A longitudinal, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with CKD patients on PD.
The patients were randomised into two groups: propolis that received four capsules of 100 mg (400 mg/day), containing concentrated and standardised dry EPP-AF® Brazilian green propolis extract) or placebo, four capsules of 100 mg (400 mg/day), of magnesium stearate, silicon dioxide, and microcrystalline cellulose, for two months. Plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were evaluated by ELISA. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses were performed to evaluate the transcriptional expression levels of Nrf2 and NF-κB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, a lipid peroxidation marker, was measured as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Routine biochemical markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), were analysed using commercial kits. Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT) was measured with a doppler ultrasonography device. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the number NCT04411758.
A total of 19 patients completed the study, ten patients in the propolis group (54 ± 1.0 years, five men, 7.2  (5.1) months on PD) and 9 in the placebo group (47.5 ± 15.2 years, three men, 10.8  (24.3) months on PD). The plasma levels of TNF-α reduced significantly (p = 0.02), and expression of Nrf2 showed a trend to increase (p = 0.07) after propolis supplementation.
EPP-AF® Green Propolis extract (400 mg/day) supplementation for two months appears as a potential strategy to mitigate inflammation, reducing TNF-α plasma levels in CKD patients on PD.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Oxidative stress', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Propolis, Inflammation']",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,2023-03-20,"[{'lastname': 'Baptista', 'firstname': 'Beatriz Germer', 'initials': 'BG', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Medical Sciences, Fluminense Federal University (UFF), Niterói, RJ, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Fanton', 'firstname': 'Susane', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Cardiovascular Sciences, Fluminense Federal University (UFF), Niterói, RJ, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Ribeiro', 'firstname': 'Márcia', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Biological Sciences - Physiology, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Cardozo', 'firstname': 'Ludmila Fmf', 'initials': 'LF', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Cardiovascular Sciences, Fluminense Federal University (UFF), Niterói, RJ, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Regis', 'firstname': 'Bruna', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Cardiovascular Sciences, Fluminense Federal University (UFF), Niterói, RJ, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Alvarenga', 'firstname': 'Livia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Graduate Program in Medical Sciences, Fluminense Federal University (UFF), Niterói, RJ, Brazil; Graduate Program in Biological Sciences - Physiology, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Ribeiro-Alves', 'firstname': 'Marcelo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'HIV/AIDS Clinical Research Center, National Institute of Infectology (INI/Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro-Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Berretta', 'firstname': 'Andresa A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Research, Development, and Innovation Department, Apis Flora Indl.

Fibrosis of the peritoneal membrane was associated with MACE occurrence and earlier MACE, but not with the patient or membrane survival. Serum α-Klotho bellow 742 pg/mL was related to the submesothelial thickness of the peritoneal membrane. This cutoff stratified the patients according to the risk of MACE and time until MACE. Uremic levels of galectin-3 were associated with PD failure and time until PD failure. This work unveils peritoneal membrane fibrosis as a window to the vulnerability of the cardiovascular system, whose mechanisms and links to biological aging need to be better investigated. Galectin-3 and α-Klotho are putative tools to tailor patient management in this home-based renal replacement therapy.","['cardiovascular toxicity', 'chronic kidney disease', 'galectin-3', 'uremic toxins', 'α-Klotho']",International journal of molecular sciences,2023-03-12,"[{'lastname': 'Branco', 'firstname': 'Patrícia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Santa Cruz, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (CHLO), 2790-134 Lisboa, Portugal.\niNOVA4Health, NOVA Medical School|Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, NMS|FCM, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 1150-082 Lisboa, Portugal.\nCentro Clínico Académico de Lisboa, 1159-056 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Calça', 'firstname': 'Rita', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Santa Cruz, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (CHLO), 2790-134 Lisboa, Portugal.\niNOVA4Health, NOVA Medical School|Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, NMS|FCM, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 1150-082 Lisboa, Portugal.\nCentro Clínico Académico de Lisboa, 1159-056 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Martins', 'firstname': 'Ana Rita', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Santa Cruz, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (CHLO), 2790-134 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Mateus', 'firstname': 'Catarina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Santa Cruz, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (CHLO), 2790-134 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Jervis', 'firstname': 'Maria João', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Surgery Department, Hospital Santa Cruz, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (CHLO), 2740-134 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Gomes', 'firstname': 'Daniel Pinto', 'initials': 'DP', 'affiliation': 'Pathology Department, Hospital Santa Cruz, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (CHLO), 2740-134 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Azeredo-Lopes', 'firstname': 'Sofia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'CHRC, NMS|FCM, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 1150-082 Lisboa, Portugal.\nDepartment of Statistics and Operational Research, Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, 1749-016 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'De Melo Junior', 'firstname': 'Antonio Ferreira', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': 'iNOVA4Health, NOVA Medical School|Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, NMS|FCM, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 1150-082 Lisboa, Portugal.\nCentro Clínico Académico de Lisboa, 1159-056 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Sousa', 'firstname': 'Cátia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'iNOVA4Health, NOVA Medical School|Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, NMS|FCM, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 1150-082 Lisboa, Portugal.\nCentro Clínico Académico de Lisboa, 1159-056 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Civantos', 'firstname': 'Ester', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Renal, Vascular and Diabetes Research Laboratory, IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spanish Biomedical Research Centre in Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Disorders (CIBERDEM), 28029 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Mas-Fontao', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Renal, Vascular and Diabetes Research Laboratory, IIS-Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Spanish Biomedical Research Centre in Diabetes and Associated Metabolic Disorders (CIBERDEM), 28029 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gaspar', 'firstname': 'Augusta', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Santa Cruz, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (CHLO), 2790-134 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramos', 'firstname': 'Sância', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Pathology Department, Hospital Santa Cruz, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (CHLO), 2740-134 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Morello', 'firstname': 'Judit', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'iNOVA4Health, NOVA Medical School|Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, NMS|FCM, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 1150-082 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Nolasco', 'firstname': 'Fernando', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'iNOVA4Health, NOVA Medical School|Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, NMS|FCM, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 1150-082 Lisboa, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodrigues', 'firstname': 'Anabela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'UMIB-Unidade Multidisciplinar de Investigação Biomédica, ITR-Laboratory for Integrative and Translational Research in Population Health, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.\nDepartamento de Nefrologia, ICBAS-Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas Abel Salazar, Universidade do Porto, Centro Hospitalar Universitário do Porto (CHUdsA), 4050-345 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'Sofia Azeredo', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'iNOVA4Health, NOVA Medical School|Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, NMS|FCM, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 1150-082 Lisboa, Portugal.\nCentro Clínico Académico de Lisboa, 1159-056 Lisboa, Portugal.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/ijms24055020

15531625",The Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine among Peritoneal Dialysis Patients at a Second-Level Hospital in Yucatán Mexico.,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used for multiple reasons such as treatment of diseases and their symptoms, empowerment, self-care, disease prevention, dissatisfaction, adverse effects or cost of conventional medicine, perception of compatibility with beliefs, and idiosyncrasy. This study investigated CAM use in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD).
A cross-sectional survey study was conducted with 240 eligible patients with CKD in the PD program. By applying the I-CAM-Q-questionnaire, the frequency, level of satisfaction, and reasons for CAM use were explored, and the demographic and clinical data of users and non-users were analyzed. Data analysis included descriptive analysis, Student's 
The main types of CAM used were herbal medicine, and chamomile was the most commonly used. To improve the state of well-being was the main reason for use, the attributable benefit of CAM was high, and only a low percentage of users reported side effects. Only 31.8% of the users informed their physicians.
The use of CAM is popular among renal patients, and physicians are not adequately informed; in particular, the CAM type ingested represents a risk for drug interactions and toxicity.","['alternative medicine', 'chronic kidney disease', 'complementary medicine', 'peritoneal dialysis']","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2023-03-12,"[{'lastname': 'Gracida-Osorno', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Servicio de Nefrología, Hospital General Regional No. 1, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mérida 97150, Yucatán, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiménez-Martínez', 'firstname': 'Sandra Luz', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Servicio de Nefrología, Hospital General Regional No. 1, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mérida 97150, Yucatán, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Uc-Cachón', 'firstname': 'Andrés Humberto', 'initials': 'AH', 'affiliation': 'Unidad de Investigación Médica Yucatán, Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mérida 97150, Yucatán, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Molina-Salinas', 'firstname': 'Gloria María', 'initials': 'GM', 'affiliation': 'Unidad de Investigación Médica Yucatán, Unidad Médica de Alta Especialidad, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mérida 97150, Yucatán, Mexico.'}]",None,"The use of CAM is popular among renal patients, and physicians are not adequately informed; in particular, the CAM type ingested represents a risk for drug interactions and toxicity.","The main types of CAM used were herbal medicine, and chamomile was the most commonly used.

37,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36898677,Resistant hypertension in dialysis.,"Hypertension is the most common finding in chronic kidney disease patients, with prevalence ranging from 60% to 90% depending on the stage and etiology of the disease. It is also a significant independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, progression to end-stage kidney disease, and mortality. According to the current guidelines, resistant hypertension is defined in the general population as uncontrolled blood pressure on 3 or more antihypertensive drugs in adequate doses or when patients are on 4 or more antihypertensive drug categories irrespective of the blood pressure control, providing that antihypertensive treatment included diuretics. The currently established definitions of resistant hypertension are not directly applicable to the end-stage renal disease setting. The diagnosis of true resistant hypertension requires confirmation of adherence to therapy and confirmation of uncontrolled blood pressure values by ambulatory blood pressure measurement or home blood pressure measurement. In addition, the term of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension defined as an uncontrolled blood pressure on three or more antihypertensive medication classes, or use of four or more medications regardless of blood pressure level was introduced. In this comprehensive review we focused on the definitions of hypertension, therapeutic targets in patients on renal replacement therapy, including the limitations and biases. We discussed the issue of pathophysiology and assessment of blood pressure in dialyzed population, management of resistant hypertension as well as available data on prevalence of apparent treatment-resistant hypertension in end-stage renal disease. Concluding, larger sample-size and even higher quality studies about drug adherence should be conducted in the population of patients with the end-stage renal disease who are on dialysis. It also should be determined how and when blood pressure should be measured in the group of dialysis patients. Additionally, it should be stated what the target blood pressure values in this group of patients really are. The definition of resistant hypertension in this group should be revisited, and its relationship to both subclinical and clinical endpoints should be established.","['apparent treatment-resistant hypertension', 'end-stage renal disease', 'hemodialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'resistant hypertension']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2023-03-11,"[{'lastname': 'Symonides', 'firstname': 'Bartosz', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hypertension and Vascular Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lewandowski', 'firstname': 'Jacek', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hypertension and Vascular Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Małyszko', 'firstname': 'Jolanta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.'}]",None,None,None,© The Author(s) 2023.

36107911",Humeral and cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients on peritoneal dialysis.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease are at high risk for coronavirus disease 2019. Little is known about immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccination in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD).
We prospectively enrolled 306 PD patients receiving two doses of vaccines (ChAdOx1-S: 283, mRNA-1273: 23) from July 2021 at a medical center. Humeral and cellular immune responses were assessed by anti-spike IgG concentration and blood T cell interferon-γ production 30 days after vaccination. Antibody ≥0.8 U/mL and interferon-γ ≥ 100 mIU/mL were defined as positive. Antibody was also measured in 604 non-dialysis volunteers (ChAdOx1-S: 244, mRNA-1273: 360) for comparison.
PD patients had less adverse events after vaccinations than volunteers. After the first dose of vaccine, the median antibody concentrations were 8.5 U/mL and 50.4 U/mL in ChAdOx1-S group and mRNA-1273 group of PD patients, and 66.6 U/mL and 195.3 U/mL in ChAdOx1-S group and mRNA-1273 group of volunteers, respectively. And after the second dose of vaccine, the median antibody concentrations were 344.8 U/mL and 9941.0 U/mL in ChAdOx1-S group and mRNA-1273 group of PD patients, and 620.3 U/mL and 3845.0 U/mL in ChAdOx1-S group and mRNA-1273 group of volunteers, respectively. The median IFN-γ concentration was 182.8 mIU/mL in ChAdOx1-S group, which was substantially lower than the median concentration 476.8 mIU/mL in mRNA-1273 group of PD patients.
Both vaccines were safe and resulted in comparable antibody seroconversion in PD patients when compared with volunteers. However, mRNA-1273 vaccine induced significantly higher antibody and T cell response than ChAdOx1-S in PD patients. Booster doses are recommended for PD patients after two doses of ChAdOx1-S vaccination.","['Humeral immunity', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'T cell immunity']",Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,2023-03-10,"[{'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Zhi-Ye', 'initials': 'ZY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Chun-Fu', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Tai-Shuan', 'initials': 'TS', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Shao-Yu', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Shih-I', 'initials': 'SI', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Bei-Hu Branch, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Mei-Jun', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Chun-Min', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Pediatric Allergy, Immunology and Rheumatology Division, Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Yu-Tsung', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yi-Ting', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Division of Blood Purification, Department of Integrated Diagnostics & Therapeutics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

31582466",Comorbidity and nutritional status in adult with advanced chronic kidney disease influence the decision-making choice of renal replacement therapy modality: A retrospective 5-year study.,"Nutritional and inflammation status are significant predictors of morbidity and mortality risk in advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD). To date, there are a limited number of clinical studies on the influence of nutritional status in ACKD stages 4-5 on the choice of renal replacement therapy (RRT) modality.
This study aimed to examine relationships between comorbidity and nutritional and inflammatory status and the decision-making on the choice of RRT modalities in adults with ACKD.
A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on 211 patients with ACKD with stages 4-5 from 2016 to 2021. Comorbidity was assessed using the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) according to severity (CCI: ≤ 3 and >3 points). Clinical and nutritional assessment was carried out by prognosis nutritional index (PNI), laboratory parameters [serum s-albumin, s-prealbumin, and C-reactive protein (s-CRP)], and anthropometric measurements. The initial decision-making of the different RRT modalities [(in-center, home-based hemodialysis (HD), and peritoneal dialysis (PD)] as well as the informed therapeutic options (conservative treatment of CKD or pre-dialysis living donor transplantation) were recorded. The sample was classified according to gender, time on follow-up in the ACKD unit (≤ 6 and >6 months), and the initial decision-making of RRT (in-center and home-RRT). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were carried out for evaluating the independent predictors of home-based RRT.
Of the 211 patients with ACKD, 47.4% (
Regular monitoring and follow-up of sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, and nutritional and inflammatory status in a multidisciplinary ACKD unit significantly influenced decision-making on the choice of RRT modality and outcome in patients with non-dialysis ACKD.","['Charlson comorbidity index', 'advanced chronic kidney disease', 'comorbidity', 'home-based renal replacement therapy', 'nutritional status', 'prognosis nutritional index', 'protein-energy wasting', 'renal replacement therapy']",Frontiers in nutrition,2023-03-07,"[{'lastname': 'Álvarez-García', 'firstname': 'Graciela', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Nogueira Pérez', 'firstname': 'Ángel', 'initials': 'Á', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Prieto Alaguero', 'firstname': 'María Pilar', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Pérez Garrote', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Díaz Testillano', 'firstname': 'Aránzazu', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Moral Caballero', 'firstname': 'Miguel Ángel', 'initials': 'MÁ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruperto', 'firstname': 'Mar', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Universidad San Pablo-CEU, CEU Universities, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'González Blázquez', 'firstname': 'Cristina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, School of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Barril', 'firstname': 'Guillermina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.'}]",None,"Regular monitoring and follow-up of sociodemographic factors, comorbidity, and nutritional and inflammatory status in a multidisciplinary ACKD unit significantly influenced decision-making on the choice of RRT modality and outcome in patients with non-dialysis ACKD.","Of the 211 patients with ACKD, 47.4% (","Copyright © 2023 Álvarez-García, Pérez, Alaguero, Garrote, Testillano, Caballero, Ruperto, Blázquez and Barril.","10.3389/fnut.2023.1105573

40,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36869794,Parathyroidectomy versus oral cinacalcet on cardiovascular parameters in peritoneal dialysis patients with advanced secondary hyperparathyroidism (PROCEED): A randomized trial.,"This trial aimed to evaluate oral cinacalcet versus total parathyroidectomy with forearm autografting (PTx) on cardiovascular surrogate outcomes and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures in dialysis patients with advanced SHPT.
In this pilot prospective randomized trial conducted in two university-affiliated hospitals, 65 adult peritoneal dialysis patients with advanced SHPT were randomized to receive either oral cinacalcet or PTx. Primary endpoints were changes in left ventricular (LV) mass index by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and coronary artery calcium scores (CACS) over 12 months. Secondary endpoints included changes in heart valves calcium scores, aortic stiffness, biochemical parameters of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disease (CKD-MBD) and HRQOL measures over 12 months.
Changes in LV mass index, CACS, heart valves calcium score, aortic pulse wave velocity and HRQOL did not differ between-groups or within-groups, despite significant reductions in plasma calcium, phosphorus and intact parathyroid hormone in both groups. Cinacalcet-treated patients experienced more cardiovascular-related hospitalizations than those who underwent PTx (P = 0.008) but the difference became insignificant after adjusting for baseline difference in heart failure (P = 0.43). With the same monitoring frequency, cinacalcet-treated patients had fewer hospitalizations due to hypercalcemia (1.8%) than patients who underwent PTx (16.7%) (P = 0.005). No significant changes were observed in HRQOL measures in either group.
Both cinacalcet and PTx effectively improved various biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD and stabilized but did not reduce LV mass, coronary artery and heart valves calcification, arterial stiffness or improve patient-centered HRQOL measures in PD patients with advanced SHPT. Cinacalcet may be used in place of PTx for treating advanced SHPT. Long-term and powered studies are required to evaluate PTx versus cinacalcet on hard cardiovascular outcomes in dialysis patients.","['advanced secondary hyperparathyroidism', 'cinacalcet', 'parathyroidectomy', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'randomized trial']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2023-03-05,"[{'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Angela Yee-Moon', 'initials': 'AY', 'affiliation': 'University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong.'}, {'lastname': 'Lo', 'firstname': 'Wai Kei', 'initials': 'WK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Tung Wah Hospital, Hong Kong.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheung', 'firstname': 'Stephen Chi-Wai', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Queen Mary Hospital.'}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Tak-Ka', 'initials': 'TK', 'affiliation': 'University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong.'}, {'lastname': 'Yau', 'firstname': 'Yat-Yin', 'initials': 'YY', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical Imaging Center, Hong Kong.'}, {'lastname': 'Lang', 'firstname': 'Brian Hung-Hin', 'initials': 'BH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.'}]",None,None,"Changes in LV mass index, CACS, heart valves calcium score, aortic pulse wave velocity and HRQOL did not differ between-groups or within-groups, despite significant reductions in plasma calcium, phosphorus and intact parathyroid hormone in both groups.

28716855",Home dialysis in older adults: challenges and solutions.,"There is a rising demand for dialysis in the older population given the increased numbers of older adults living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) progressing to kidney failure. Home dialysis, i.e. peritoneal dialysis (PD) and home hemodialysis (HHD), has been available for decades, but more recently there has been a rapid increase in home dialysis utilization as patients and clinicians consider its practical and clinical advantages. For older adults, incident home dialysis utilization more than doubled and prevalent home dialysis growth nearly doubled over the past decade. Whilst its advantages and recent rise in popularity are evident, there are numerous barriers and challenges that are important to consider prior to initiating older adults on home dialysis. Some nephrology healthcare professionals do not view home dialysis as an option for older adults. Successful delivery of home dialysis for older adults may be made even more difficult by physical or cognitive limitations, concerns around dialysis adequacy, and treatment-related complications, as well as challenges relating to caregiver burnout and patient frailty that are unique to home dialysis and older adults. Ultimately, it would be important for clinicians, patients and their caregivers to define what constitutes a 'successful therapy' to ensure treatment goals are aligned towards each individual's priorities of care, considering the complex challenges that surround an older adult receiving home dialysis. In this review, we evaluate some of the key challenges surrounding the delivery of home dialysis to older adults and propose potential solutions based on updated evidence to overcome these challenges.","['challenges', 'geriatric nephrology', 'home dialysis', 'older adults', 'solutions']",Clinical kidney journal,2023-03-04,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Henry H L', 'initials': 'HHL', 'affiliation': 'Renal Research Laboratory, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Royal North Shore Hospital & The University of Sydney, St Leonards, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Dhaygude', 'firstname': 'Ajay P', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Preston, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Mitra', 'firstname': 'Sandip', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Manchester Academy of Health Sciences Centre, Manchester University Hospitals, Manchester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Tennankore', 'firstname': 'Karthik K', 'initials': 'KK', 'affiliation': 'Dalhousie University and Nova Scotia Health, Dickson Building, 5820 University Avenue, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.'}]",None,None,None,© The Author(s) 2022.

21338251",Demand for Water-Soluble Vitamins in a Group of Patients with CKD versus Interventions and Supplementation-A Systematic Review.,"Increasingly, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is becoming an inevitable consequence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. As the disease progresses, and through dialysis, the need for and loss of water-soluble vitamins both increase. This review article looks at the benefits and possible risks of supplementing these vitamins with the treatment of CKD.
Data in the PubMed and Embase databases were analyzed. The keywords ""chronic kidney disease"", in various combinations, are associated with thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, folates, niacin, cobalamin, and vitamin C. This review focuses on the possible use of water-soluble vitamin supplementation to improve pharmacological responses and the overall clinical condition of patients.
The mechanism of supportive supplementation is based on reducing oxidative stress, covering the increased demand and losses resulting from the treatment method. In the initial period of failure (G2-G3a), it does not require intervention, but later, especially in the case of inadequate nutrition, the inclusion of supplementation with folate and cobalamin may bring benefits. Such supplementation seems to be a necessity in patients with stage G4 or G5 (uremia). Conversely, the inclusion of additional B6 supplementation to reduce CV risk may be considered. At stage 3b and beyond (stages 4-5), the inclusion of niacin at a dose of 400-1000 mg, depending on the patient's tolerance, is required to lower the phosphate level. The inclusion of supplementation with thiamine and other water-soluble vitamins, especially in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients, is necessary for reducing dialysis losses. Allowing hemodialysis patients to take low doses of oral vitamin C effectively reduces erythropoietin dose requirements and improves anemia in functional iron-deficient patients. However, it should be considered that doses of B vitamins that are several times higher than the recommended dietary allowance of consumption may exacerbate left ventricular diastolic dysfunction in CKD patients.
Taking into account the research conducted so far, it seems that the use of vitamin supplementation in CKD patients may have a positive impact on the treatment process and maintaining a disease-free condition.","['chronic kidney disease', 'vitamin C', 'vitamin supplementation', 'vitamins B']",Nutrients,2023-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Kędzierska-Kapuza', 'firstname': 'Karolina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'State Medical Institute of the Ministry of Interior and Administration in Warsaw, 137 Wołoska St., 02-507 Warsaw, Poland.\nCenter of Postgraduate Medical Education in Warsaw, Department of Gastroenterological Surgery and Transplantology, 137 Wołoska St., 02-507 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Szczuko', 'firstname': 'Urszula', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Nutrition and Metabolomic, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, 71-460 Szczecin, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Stolińska', 'firstname': 'Hanna', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Love Yourself Hanna Stolińska, 112 Sobieskiego St., 00-764 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Bakaloudi', 'firstname': 'Dimitra Rafailia', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Oncology, General Hospital of Thessaloniki ""G.

28379433",Role of the Gut Microbiota in Children with Kidney Disease.,"Disruption of the composition and structure of the gut microbiota, namely dysbiosis, dictates the pathophysiology of kidney diseases. The bidirectional kidney-gut axis is of interest in chronic kidney disease (CKD); the uremic milieu leads to intestinal dysbiosis and gut microbial metabolites and toxins implicated in the loss of kidney function and increased comorbidity burden. Considering that kidney diseases can originate in childhood or even earlier in fetal life, identification of the pathogenetic connection between gut microbiota dysbiosis and the development of pediatric renal diseases deserves more attention. This review concentrates on the pathogenic link between dysbiotic gut microbiota and pediatric renal diseases, covering CKD, kidney transplantation, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, and idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Gut microbiota-targeted therapies including dietary intervention, probiotics, prebiotics, postbiotics and fecal microbial transplantation are discussed for their potential for the treatment of pediatric renal diseases. A deeper understanding of gut microbiota in pediatric renal diseases will aid in developing innovative gut microbiota-targeted interventions for preventing or attenuating the global burden of kidney diseases.","['children', 'chronic kidney disease', 'gut microbiota', 'short-chain fatty acid', 'trimethylamine N-oxide', 'tryptophan', 'uremic toxin']","Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2023-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Tain', 'firstname': 'You-Lin', 'initials': 'YL', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan.\nInstitute for Translational Research in Biomedicine, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan.\nCollege of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hsu', 'firstname': 'Chien-Ning', 'initials': 'CN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung 833, Taiwan.\nSchool of Pharmacy, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/children10020269

35112137",Pre-Peritoneal Dialysis Peritonitis After Saline Infusion Sonohysterogram in a Patient With an Embedded Catheter: A Case Report.,"Clear guidelines currently exist regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) prior to common diagnostic procedures. However, these guidelines do not include patients with subcutaneously embedded PD catheters who are awaiting PD initiation although both these populations share a great deal of risk factors for infections. Issues regarding antibiotic prophylaxis and avoidable infections are bound to keep occurring if physicians are not conscious of the risks of infections shared by all patients suffering from renal failure.
Two weeks after a saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS), a 48-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease (CKD) G5 ND, type 2 diabetes, a subcutaneously embedded PD catheter, and prior abnormal uterine bleeding presented to the emergency department complaining of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and abdominal pain. The patient received no antibiotic prophylaxis prior to her SIS.
The final diagnosis of peritonitis was established after acute kidney injury, gastroenteritis, and small bowel obstruction were considered and ruled out. A delay in the final diagnosis occurred because of the complex presentation, the fact that the patient had not yet initiated PD, and the presence of concomitant anion gap metabolic acidosis and an acute elevation of the patient's creatinine.
The patient was started on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics when the diagnosis of peritonitis was established. Insulin and intravenous bicarbonate infusions were used to correct the patient's anion gap metabolic acidosis. Surgical debridement of the necrotic subcutaneous tissue and removal of the embedded PD catheter were necessary.
The patient's infection resolved completely as did her anion gap metabolic acidosis. The patient had to transfer permanently from PD to hemodialysis for her renal replacement therapy.
This case report serves as a good reminder that physicians should keep in mind the possibility of peritonitis in patients with embedded PD catheters. As these patients are also at risk of infections, antibiotic prophylaxis should be used in patients with embedded catheters in the same way it is used for PD patients prior to obstetrical, gynecological, or gastrointestinal procedures.
Il existe des directives claires quant à la prophylaxie antibiotique à utiliser préalablement aux procédures de diagnostic courantes chez les patients sous dialyse péritonéale (DP). Les patients disposant d’un cathéter de DP implanté sous-cutané en attendant le début de la dialyse ne sont pas inclus dans ces recommandations, même si cette population partage plusieurs facteurs de risque d’infections avec les patients déjà sous DP. Des enjeux liés à la prophylaxie antibiotique et aux infections évitables continueront de se poser si les médecins ignorent les risques d’infections partagés par tous les patients souffrant d’insuffisance rénale.
Une femme âgée de 48 ans atteinte d’insuffisance rénale chronique (IRC) G5 ND et de diabète de type 2 s’étant présentée aux urgences deux semaines après une sono-hystérographie (SHG) avec infusion intra-utérine de solution saline. La patiente portait un cathéter de PD implanté sous-cutané et avait déjà eu des saignements utérins anormaux dans le passé. Elle se plaignait de nausées, de vomissements, de diarrhées, de faiblesse générale et de douleurs abdominales. Elle n’avait reçu aucune prophylaxie antibiotique avant la SHG.
Le diagnostic final de péritonite a été établi après que l’insuffisance rénale aiguë, la gastro-entérite et une obstruction de l’intestin grêle aient été envisagées et écartées. Le diagnostic final a été retardé en raison de la présentation complexe, du fait que la patiente n’avait pas encore amorcé la DP et de la présence concomitante d’une acidose métabolique à trou anionique et d’une élévation subite de la créatinine.
La patiente a reçu des antibiotiques à large specter par voie intraveineuse lorsque le diagnostic de péritonite a été établi. Des infusions d’insuline et de bicarbonate par voie intraveineuse ont été utilisées pour corriger l’acidose métabolique à trou anionique. Un débridement chirurgical des tissus sous-cutanés nécrosés et l’ablation du cathéter PD se sont avérés nécessaires.
L’infection a guéri complètement, tout comme l’acidose métabolique à trou anionique. La patiente a dû passer définitivement de la DP à l’hémodialyse pour son traitement de suppléance rénale.
Ce cas illustre bien que les médecins devraient toujours garder les risques de péritonite à l’esprit lorsqu’ils traitent des patients portant un cathéter de PD implanté sous-cutané. Puisque ces patients présentent eux aussi un risque d’infection, la prophylaxie antibiotique devrait leur être administrée avant les procédures obstétricales, gynécologiques ou gastro-intestinales, comme c’est le cas pour les patients sous DP.","['antibiotic prophylaxis', 'embedded peritoneal dialysis catheter', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'peritonitis', 'pre-peritoneal dialysis peritonitis']",Canadian journal of kidney health and disease,2023-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Cosmatos', 'firstname': 'Alexandre', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'McCormick', 'firstname': 'Brendan', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nKidney Research Centre, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Blew', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Division of Urology, Department of Surgery, The Ottawa Hospital, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Pierre Antoine', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nKidney Research Centre, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, ON, Canada.'}]",None,None,None,"© The Author(s) 2023.

34014999",Magnesium and Fracture Risk in the General Population and Patients Receiving Dialysis: A Narrative Review.,"Magnesium is an essential mineral for bone metabolism, but little is known about how magnesium intake alters fracture risk. We conducted a narrative review to better understand how magnesium intake, through supplementation, diet, or altering the concentration of dialysate magnesium, affects mineral bone disease and the risk of fracture in individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease.
Peer-reviewed clinical trials and observational studies.
We searched for relevant articles in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The methodologic quality of clinical trials was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Black criteria checklist.
The role of magnesium intake in fracture prevention is unclear in both the general population and in patients receiving maintenance dialysis. In those with normal kidney function, 2 meta-analyses showed higher bone mineral density in those with higher dietary magnesium, whereas 1 systematic review showed no effect on fracture risk. In patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, a higher concentration of dialysate magnesium is associated with a lower concentration of parathyroid hormone, but little is known about other bone-related outcomes. In 2 observational studies of patients receiving hemodialysis, a higher concentration of serum magnesium was associated with a lower risk of hip fracture.
This narrative review included only articles written in English. Observed effects of magnesium intake in the general population may not be applicable to those with chronic kidney disease particularly in those receiving dialysis.
Le magnésium est un minéral essentiel pour le métabolisme osseux, mais on en sait peu sur la façon dont un apport en magnésium modifie le risque de fracture. Nous avons procédé à un examen narratif afin de mieux comprendre comment les maladies liées à la densité minérale osseuse et le risque de fracture sont affectés par un apport en magnésium (supplémentation, régime alimentaire ou modification de la concentration de dialysat de magnésium) chez les personnes atteintes d’insuffisance rénale.
Essais cliniques et études observationnelles examinés par des pairs.
Nous avons répertorié les articles pertinents dans les bases de données MEDLINE et EMBASE. Une version modifiée des critères de contrôle de la qualité des études de Downs et Black a servi à évaluer la qualité méthodologique des essais cliniques retenus.
Le rôle d’un apport en magnésium dans la prévention des fractures n’est pas clair, tant dans la population générale que chez les patients sous dialyse d’entretien. Chez les personnes ayant une fonction rénale normale, deux méta-analyses ont montré que les personnes dont le régime alimentaire est riche en magnésium présentent une densité minérale osseuse plus élevée; alors qu’une revue systématique n’a montré aucun effet sur le risque de fracture. Chez les patients sous hémodialyse d’entretien ou dialyse péritonéale, une concentration plus élevée de dialysat de magnésium est associée à une plus faible concentration d’hormone parathyroïdienne, mais on en sait peu sur les autres effets liés aux os. Dans deux études observationnelles portant sur des patients sous hémodialyse, une concentration plus élevée de magnésium sérique a été associée à un risque plus faible de fracture de la hanche.
Cet examen narratif ne comprend que des articles rédigés en anglais. Il est possible que les effets d’un apport en magnésium observés dans la population générale ne puissent s’appliquer aux personnes atteintes d’une néphropathie chronique, en particulier aux personnes sous dialyse.","['fracture', 'hemodialysis', 'magnesium', 'mineral bone disease', 'parathyroid horomone']",Canadian journal of kidney health and disease,2023-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Cowan', 'firstname':

51,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36812906,Aortic Stenosis and Aortic Valve Replacement Among Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Narrative Review.,"Aortic stenosis (AS) can present with dyspnea, angina, syncope, and palpitations and this presents a diagnostic challenge as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and other commonly found comorbid conditions may present similarly. While medical optimization is an important aspect in management, aortic valve replacement (AVR) by surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is the definitive treatment. Patients with concomitant CKD and AS require special consideration as it is known that CKD is associated with progression of AS and poor long-term outcomes.
To summarize and review current existing literature on patients with both CKD and AS regarding disease progression, dialysis method, surgical intervention, and post operative outcomes.
The incidence of aortic stenosis increases with age but has also been independently associated with chronic kidney disease and furthermore with hemodialysis. Regular dialysis with hemodialysis vs. peritoneal dialysis and female gender have been associated with progression of AS. Management of aortic stenosis is multidisciplinary and requires planning and interventions by the ""Heart-Kidney Team"" to decrease risk of further inducing kidney injury among high-risk population. Both TAVR and SAVR are effective interventions for patients with severe symptomatic AS, but TAVR has been associated with better short-term renal and cardiovascular outcomes.
Special consideration must be taken in patients with both CKD and AS. The choice of whether to undergo hemodialysis (HD) vs. peritoneal dialysis (PD) among patients with CKD is multifactorial but studies have shown benefit regarding AS progression among those who undergo PD. The choice regarding AVR approach is likewise the same. TAVR has been associated with decreased complications among CKD patients, but the decision is multifactorial and requires a comprehensive discussion with the Heart-Kidney Team as many other factors play a role in the decision including preference, prognosis, and other risk factors.",[],Cardiorenal medicine,2023-02-23,"[{'lastname': 'Rivera', 'firstname': 'Frederick Berro', 'initials': 'FB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cu', 'firstname': 'Maria Victoria Valenzona', 'initials': 'MVV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cua', 'firstname': 'Sharmaine Jesselyn', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'De Luna', 'firstname': 'Deogracias Villa', 'initials': 'DV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lerma', 'firstname': 'Edgar V', 'initials': 'EV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McCullough', 'firstname': 'Peter A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kazory', 'firstname': 'Amir', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Collado', 'firstname': 'Fareed Moses S', 'initials': 'FMS', 'affiliation': None}]",None,"The incidence of aortic stenosis increases with age but has also been independently associated with chronic kidney disease and furthermore with hemodialysis.

10647064",Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to apolipoprotein B ratio predicts mortality and cardiovascular events in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"The ratio of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/apolipoprotein B (apo B) is associated with all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the LDL-C/apo B ratio (LAR) and all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
A total of 1199 incident PD patients were enrolled from November 1, 2005 to August 31, 2019. The LAR was used to divide the patients into two groups by X-Tile software and restricted cubic splines using 1.04 as the cutoff. The incidence of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events at follow-up was compared according to LAR.
Of the 1199 patients, 58.0% were men, the mean age was 49.3 ± 14.5 years, 225 patients had a history of diabetes, and 117 patients had prior cardiovascular disease. During the follow-up period, 326 patients died, and 178 patients experienced cardiovascular events. After full adjustment, a low LAR was significantly associated with HRs for all-cause mortality of 1.37 (95% CI 1.02-1.84, P = 0.034) and for cardiovascular events of 1.61 (95% CI 1.10-2.36, P = 0.014).
This study suggests that a low LAR is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in PD patients, indicating that the LAR may provide significant information when assessing all-cause mortality and cardiovascular risks.","['All-cause mortality', 'Apolipoprotein B', 'Cardiovascular events', 'Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol', 'Peritoneal dialysis']",International urology and nephrology,2023-02-23,"[{'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'Chuanfei', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17#Yongwai Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China.\nDepartment of Gastroenterology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhan', 'firstname': 'Qing', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17#Yongwai Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China.\nFuzhou Medical College, Nanchang University, Fuzhou, 344000, Jiangxi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lv', 'firstname': 'Linghai', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17#Yongwai Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China.\nShangrao Guangxin District People's Hospital, Shangrao, 334000, Jiangxi, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yanbing', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17#Yongwai Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhan', 'firstname': 'Xiaojiang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 17#Yongwai Street, Nanchang, 330006, Jiangxi, China. zhanxiaogang87@163.com.'}]",None,"This study suggests that a low LAR is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in PD patients, indicating that the LAR may provide significant information when assessing all-cause mortality and cardiovascular risks.","Of the 1199 patients, 58.0% were men, the mean age was 49.3 ± 14.5 years, 225 patients had a history of diabetes, and 117 patients had prior cardiovascular disease.

53,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36807408,"From MIA to FIFA: The vicious matrix of frailty, inflammation, fluid overload and atherosclerosis in peritoneal dialysis.","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Two decades ago, the common co-existence of malnutrition and systemic inflammation PD patients with atherosclerosis and CVD led to the proposed terminology of 'malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis (MIA) syndrome'. Although the importance of malnutrition is well accepted, frailty represents a more comprehensive assessment of the physical and functional capability of the patient and encompasses the contributions of sarcopenia (a key component of malnutrition), obesity, cardiopulmonary as well as neuropsychiatric impairment. In recent years, it is also increasingly recognized that fluid overload is not only the consequence but also play an important role in the pathogenesis of CVD. Moreover, fluid overload is closely linked with the systemic inflammatory status, presumably by gut oedema, gastrointestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction and leakage of bacterial fragments to the systemic circulation. There are now a wealth of published evidence to show intricate relations between frailty, inflammation, fluid overload and atherosclerotic disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those on PD, a phenomenon that we propose the term 'FIFA complex'. In this system, frailty and atherosclerotic disease may be regarded as two patient-oriented outcomes, while inflammation and fluid overload are two inter-connected pathogenic processes. However, there remain limited data on how the treatment of one component affect the others. It is also important to define how treatment of fluid overload affect the systemic inflammatory status and to develop effective anti-inflammatory strategies that could alleviate atherosclerotic disease and frailty.","['cardiovascular disease', 'chronic kidney disease', 'nutrition', 'sarcopenia']","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2023-02-23,"[{'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Gordon Chun-Kau', 'initials': 'GC', 'affiliation': 'Carol & Richard Yu Peritoneal Dialysis Research Centre, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.'}, {'lastname': 'Fung', 'firstname': 'Winston Wing-Shing', 'initials': 'WW', 'affiliation': 'Carol & Richard Yu Peritoneal Dialysis Research Centre, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.'}, {'lastname': 'Szeto', 'firstname': 'Cheuk-Chun', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Carol & Richard Yu Peritoneal Dialysis Research Centre, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.\nLi Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences (LiHS), Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.'}, {'lastname': 'Ng', 'firstname': 'Jack Kit-Chung', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Carol & Richard Yu Peritoneal Dialysis Research Centre, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.'}]",None,None,None,"© 2023 The Authors.

25161990",Effect of Omega-3 Fatty Acids Supplementation on Homocysteine Level in Patients Undergoing Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis.,"One of the most common diseases with high morbidity and mortality rates is chronic kidney disease. Cardiovascular disease affects most patients with chronic kidney disorders, particularly patients undergoing dialysis; hence, appropriate prevention and management approaches are essential. This study aimed to evaluate the reduction of inflammatory biomarkers, especially homocysteine, by omega-3 fatty acids in peritoneal dialysis patients.
This study enrolled 60 peritoneal dialysis patients who met specified inclusion and exclusion criteria and were randomized to intervention or placebo groups. Omega-3 capsules were given at a dose of 3 g/d for 8 weeks. Inflammatory markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), homocysteine, albumin, and lipid profile measured before and after the study.
Results of this trial revealed that the levels of homocysteine, hs-CRP, and albumin did not change significantly during the study. Analysis of lipid profiles before and after intervention showed omega-3 has no significant effect on the level of total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; However, the level of triglyceride reduced remarkably (
Omega-3 does not seem to be able to change the inflammatory markers significantly, particularly homocysteine. More extensive trials must be conducted to better understand the impact of omega-3 on inflammatory and nutritional markers, particularly in peritoneal dialysis patients.","['End-stage renal disease', 'homocysteine', 'omega-3 fatty acids', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Journal of research in pharmacy practice,2023-02-18,"[{'lastname': 'Gholipur-Shahraki', 'firstname': 'Tahereh', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacy Practice, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Vahdat', 'firstname': 'Sahar', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Isfahan Kidney Diseases Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Seirafian', 'firstname': 'Shiva', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Isfahan Kidney Diseases Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Pourfarzam', 'firstname': 'Morteza', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Badri', 'firstname': 'Shirinsadat', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacy Practice, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.\nIsfahan Kidney Diseases Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.'}]",None,"Omega-3 does not seem to be able to change the inflammatory markers significantly, particularly homocysteine.

55,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36787894,Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sacubitril/valsartan in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"There is little information on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sacubitril/valsartan (SV) in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD) complicated with hypertension or heart failure (HF). This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SV in PD patients with complications of hypertension or HF.
This was an open-label and cross-sectional study investigating PD patients diagnosed with hypertension or New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II-IV HF. The concentrations of valsartan, sacubitril, and sacubitrilat (LBQ657) were measured by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in plasma, urine and peritoneal dialysate samples. Pharmacodynamics were evaluated by comparing changes in mean sitting systolic blood pressure (msSBP), mean sitting diastolic blood pressure (msDBP), mean sitting heart rate (msHR), N-terminal-pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF).
Forty patients with PD were enrolled including 27 (67.5%) patients with hypertension, 4 (10%) patients with HF and 9 (22.5%) patients with both hypertension and HF. This study included three treatment cohorts: 50 mg twice daily (BID), 100 mg once daily (QD) and 100 mg BID. The plasma maximum drug concentrations in the 100 mg BID group were 1995 ± 1499 ng/mL for valsartan, 171 ± 148 ng/mL for sacubitril and 13 686 ± 7418 ng/mL for LBQ657. The 24 h recovery rate of LBQ657 was 3.77% in urine and 2.23% in peritoneal dialysate. After taking SV, msSBP and msDBP decreased by 19.25 ± 10.32 mmHg and 10.10 ± 8.00 mmHg from baseline, respectively. NT-proBNP decreased by 1436.50 (0.00-18198.00) from baseline, while LVEF increased by 5.00 (-0.25-9.25) from baseline after SV treatment.
PD and residual renal function contributed only to a minor degree to the elimination of LBQ657. Additionally, a dose of 100 mg BID SV is safe and effective in patients with PD with complications of hypertension or HF.","['chronic kidney disease', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'pharmacodynamics', 'pharmacokinetics', 'sacubitril/valsartan']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2023-02-15,"[{'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Yi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Kidney Research Institute, Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Yaan People's Hospital, Sichuan, Yaan, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Jin', 'firstname': 'Ying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Trial Center/NMPA Key Laboratory for Clinical Research and Evaluation of Innovative Drug, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xue', 'firstname': 'Hen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Yaan People's Hospital, Sichuan, Yaan, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Runhan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Trial Center/NMPA Key Laboratory for Clinical Research and Evaluation of Innovative Drug, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Mengyu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Trial Center/NMPA Key Laboratory for Clinical Research and Evaluation of Innovative Drug, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liao', 'firstname': 'Ruoxi', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Research Institute, Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Maoli', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Yaan People's Hospital, Sichuan, Yaan, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Xueli', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Research Institute, Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Xueqin', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Research Institute, Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qin', 'firstname': 'Min', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Research Institute, Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Kuo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Research Institute, Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zou', 'firstname': 'Huiqun', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Research Institute, Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Gan', 'firstname': 'Ying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Research Institute, Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Zhenlei', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Trial Center/NMPA Key Laboratory for Clinical Research and Evaluation of Innovative Drug, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Trial Center/NMPA Key Laboratory for Clinical Research and Evaluation of Innovative Drug, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhong', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Research Institute, Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Ping', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Research Institute, Department of Nephrology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Sichuan, Chengdu, China.'}]",None,None,"Forty patients with PD were enrolled including 27 (67.5%) patients with hypertension, 4 (10%) patients with HF and 9 (22.5%) patients with both hypertension and HF.

56,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36780006,Tidal continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis in children.,"About 10% of all home peritoneal dialysis regimens in children with chronic kidney disease stage 5 are reported to involve some form of a tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD) prescription. Despite this, there remain several gaps in how pediatric nephrologists approach the use of TPD. This stems from a combination of factors such as the confusing technical terminology pertaining to TPD, seemingly conflicting data on the risks, benefits, and indications for TPD, and lastly, limited published guidelines on the practical aspects of how to write a TPD prescription, based on the indication, in children. Our educational review, using evidence-based data, attempts to bridge this gap and provide an easy-to-use guide on the key practical aspects of TPD in children.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Solute clearance', 'Tidal']","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2023-02-14,"[{'lastname': 'Butani', 'firstname': 'Lavjay', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Davis, 2516 Stockton Blvd, Room 348, Sacramento, CA, 95817, USA. lbutani@ucdavis.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Haddad', 'firstname': 'Maha', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Davis, 2516 Stockton Blvd, Room 348, Sacramento, CA, 95817, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Joseph', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, USA.'}]",None,None,None,© 2023.

16391585",Low Free Triiodothyronine as a More Sensitive Predictor of Survival Than Total Testosterone among Dialysis Men.,"Some endocrine disorders, previously considered benign, may be related to a poorer prognosis for patients with renal failure. Both low serum free triiodothyronine (fT3) and low total testosterone (TT) concentrations have been considered as predictors of death in dialysis patients, but the results of studies are inconsistent. In our study, we evaluated the relationships of the serum thyroid hormone levels and the total testosterone levels with survival in male dialysis patients.
Forty-eight male dialysis patients, 31 on hemodialysis (HD) and 17 on peritoneal dialysis (PD), aged 61.4 ± 10.0, 59.2 ± 12.2 years, respectively, were included in the study. Serum thyroid hormones and total testosterone were measured.
During the 12-month follow-up, nine all-cause deaths were recorded. The concentrations of fT3 were significantly lower in those who died than in the survivors (
In the group of male dialysis patients, the serum concentration of fT3 had a better prognostic value in terms of survival than the total testosterone. A linear relationship between the fT3 levels and testosterone levels in men undergoing hemodialysis may confirm the hypothesis that some of the hormonal changes observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD) may have a common cause.","['dialysis', 'fT3', 'survival', 'total testosterone']",Nutrients,2023-02-12,"[{'lastname': 'Leśniak', 'firstname': 'Ksymena', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Diseases, Nephrology and Dialysis, Military Institute of Medicine-National Research Institute, 04-141 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Rymarz', 'firstname': 'Aleksandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Diseases, Nephrology and Dialysis, Military Institute of Medicine-National Research Institute, 04-141 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sobol', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics and Human Physiology, Medical University of Warsaw, 02-004 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Niemczyk', 'firstname': 'Stanisław', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Diseases, Nephrology and Dialysis, Military Institute of Medicine-National Research Institute, 04-141 Warsaw, Poland.'}]",None,None,"During the 12-month follow-up, nine all-cause deaths were recorded.

33971155",Novel strategies in nephrology: what to expect from the future?,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) will become the fifth global case of death by 2040. Its largest impact is on premature mortality but the number of persons with kidney failure requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) is also increasing dramatically. Current RRT is suboptimal due to the shortage of kidney donors and dismal outcomes associated with both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Kidney care needs a revolution. In this review, we provide an update on emerging knowledge and technologies that will allow an earlier diagnosis of CKD, addressing the current so-called blind spot (e.g. imaging and biomarkers), and improve renal replacement therapies (wearable artificial kidneys, xenotransplantation, stem cell-derived therapies, bioengineered and bio-artificial kidneys).","['artificial kidney', 'bioengineering', 'chronic kidney disease', 'induced pluripotent stem cells', 'xenotransplantation']",Clinical kidney journal,2023-02-10,"[{'lastname': 'Copur', 'firstname': 'Sidar', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Koc University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Tanriover', 'firstname': 'Cem', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Koc University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Yavuz', 'firstname': 'Furkan', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Koc University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Soler', 'firstname': 'Maria J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Spain.\nNephrology and Kidney Transplant Research Group, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute (VHIR), Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Ortiz', 'firstname': 'Alberto', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid and IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Covic', 'firstname': 'Adrian', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Nephrology Clinic, Dialysis and Renal Transplant Center, 'C.I.

59,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36754369,Peritoneal transformation shortly after kidney transplantation in pediatric patients with preceding chronic peritoneal dialysis.,"The unphysiological composition of peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids induces progressive peritoneal fibrosis, hypervascularization and vasculopathy. Information on these alterations after kidney transplantation (KTx) is scant.
Parietal peritoneal tissues were obtained from 81 pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 (CKD5), 72 children on PD with low glucose degradation product (GDP) PD fluids, and from 20 children 4-8 weeks after KTx and preceding low-GDP PD. Tissues were analyzed by digital histomorphometry and quantitative immunohistochemistry.
While chronic PD was associated with peritoneal hypervascularization, after KTx vascularization was comparable to CKD5 level. Submesothelial CD45 counts were 40% lower compared to PD, and in multivariable analyses independently associated with microvessel density. In contrast, peritoneal mesothelial denudation, submesothelial thickness and fibrin abundance, number of activated, submesothelial fibroblasts and of mesothelial-mesenchymal transitioned cells were similar after KTx. Diffuse peritoneal podoplanin positivity was present in 40% of the transplanted patients. In subgroups matched for age, PD vintage, dialytic glucose exposure and peritonitis incidence, submesothelial HIF-1α abundance and angiopoietin 1/2 ratio were lower after KTx, reflecting vessel maturation, while arteriolar and microvessel p16 and cleaved Casp3 were higher. Submesothelial mast cell count and IL-6 were lower, whereas TGF-ß induced pSMAD2/3 was similar as compared to children on PD.
Peritoneal membrane damage induced with chronic administration of low-GDP PD fluids was less severe after KTx. While peritoneal microvessel density, primarily defining PD transport and ultrafiltration capacity, was normal after KTx and peritoneal inflammation less pronounced, diffuse podoplanin positivity and profibrotic activity were prevalent.","['chronic kidney disease', 'kidney transplantation', 'pediatric', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'peritoneal membrane']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2023-02-09,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Conghui', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bartosova', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Marinovic', 'firstname': 'Iva', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwab', 'firstname': 'Constantin', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schaefer', 'firstname': 'Betti', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Vondrak', 'firstname': 'Karel', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Ariceta', 'firstname': 'Gema', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Hospital Universitario Materno-Infantil Vall d' Hebron, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Zaloszyc', 'firstname': 'Ariane', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics 1, University Hospital of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Ranchin', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Service de Néphrologie Pédiatrique, Hôpital Femme Mere Enfant, Lyon, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Taylan', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Pediatric Nephrology, Children's and Adolescent's Hospital, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Büscher', 'firstname': 'Rainer', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Nephrology, University Children`s Hospital, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Oh', 'firstname': 'Jun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Nephrology, University Children's Medical Clinic, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Mehrabi', 'firstname': 'Arianeb', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmitt', 'firstname': 'Claus Peter', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.'}]",None,None,"While chronic PD was associated with peritoneal hypervascularization, after KTx vascularization was comparable to CKD5 level.

24853593",Pregnancy in women on chronic dialysis in the last decade (2010-2020): a systematic review.,"Pregnant women with end-stage renal disease on chronic dialysis are at a high risk of maternal and foetal complications. Over the years, the prognosis of their pregnancies has improved with advances in dialysis treatments and maternal and neonatal care. We conducted this systematic review to examine the recent data on maternal and foetal outcomes in pregnant women with end-stage renal failure on chronic dialysis over the last decade.
We made a systematic review of studies on pregnant women on chronic dialysis published between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2020. We searched the following electronic databases: Medline via PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library, with search strategies for each database. We checked the titles and abstracts identified by the search equation, and two independent reviewers assessed the articles retrieved. For each study, the two reviewers separately recorded the data from each selected article on a standardized data extraction form. For each article, we recorded relevant general information on the study, patient demographic characteristics, dialysis schedule, pregnancy complications and outcomes, maternal complications, and foetal and neonatal outcomes.
The literature search yielded 1668 potentially relevant abstracts. After reviewing the titles, abstracts and full text, we identified 14 studies according to the inclusion criteria. All studies were observational, nine of them were retrospective and eight were from a single-centre experience. The total number of women included in these studies was 2364 (range 8-2008) and the total number of pregnancies was 2754 (range 8-2352). The patients' ages ranged from 15 to 45 years. Obesity was observed in 808 (34.2%) women and ranged from 1 to 778. Haemodialysis was the predominant modality with 2551 (92.6%) pregnancies, and 203 (7.4%) on peritoneal dialysis. Overall, 68 out of 402 (16.9%) spontaneous miscarriages, 21 out of 402 (5.2%) therapeutic abortions and 26 (8.3%) stillbirths among 313 (stillbirths and live births) were recorded. The mean or median gestational age at delivery ranged from 25.2 to 36 weeks. The main maternal complications were preeclampsia 11.9%, hypertension 7.7% and anaemia 3.9%. Live births represented 287 (71.4%) out of 402 pregnancies, birth weight ranged from 590 to 3500 g and preterm birth was the main, most common complication in all studies, ranging from 50% to 100%. Intrauterine growth restriction was present in 5.9% and small-for-gestational-age was reported in 18.9% of neonates. There were 22 (7.6%) neonatal deaths among 287 live births and 48 (15.3%) perinatal deaths among 313 total births (stillbirths and live births).
Presumably, considering the increase in the number of publications and the total number of pregnancies reported therein, the frequency of pregnancy in patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease treated by chronic dialysis has increased. However, the practice of treating pregnant women on dialysis differs significantly among countries. These findings highlight the need to standardize the definition of outcomes and healthcare for pregnant women on dialysis.","['chronic kidney failure', 'pregnancy', 'pregnancy complications', 'pregnancy outcome', 'renal dialysis']",Clinical kidney journal,2023-02-03,"[{'lastname': 'Baouche', 'firstname': 'Hayet', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, APHP-Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, REIN Registry, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Jais', 'firstname': 'Jean-Philippe', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, APHP-Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, REIN Registry, University of Paris Cité, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Meriem', 'firstname': 'Samy', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, APHP-Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kareche', 'firstname': 'Mimi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'NephroCare Etampes, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Moranne', 'firstname': 'Olivier', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Service Nephrologie-Dialyse-Apherese, Hopital Universitaire de Nimes, CHU Caremeau Nîmes, France.\nIDESP, UMR, Université de Montpellier, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Vigneau', 'firstname': 'Cécile', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University of Rennes, CHU Rennes, INSERM, EHESP, IRSET (Institut de recherche en santé, environnement et travail) -UMR S1085, Rennes, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Couchoud', 'firstname': 'Cécile', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'REIN Registry, Agence de la biomédecine, Saint Denis La Plaine, France.'}]",None,None,"The literature search yielded 1668 potentially relevant abstracts.

32048566",Mesenteric elasticity assessed by shear wave elastography and its relationship with peritoneal function in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"We evaluated the mesenteric elasticity in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) using shear wave elastography (SWE) and investigated its relationships with peritoneal function.
Patients were recruited in our peritoneal dialysis (PD) centre between 15 July 2019 and 31 December 2021 and followed up to 31 March 2022. Twelve chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and nineteen healthy people were included as controls. Correlation, linear regression and Cox regression analyses were applied.
Of the 218 PD patients, 104 (47.8%) were male. Their mean age was 48.0 ± 13.2 years and the median PD duration was 59.0 months [interquartile range (IQR) 17.0-105]. The median mesenteric SWE value was 8.15 kPa (IQR 5.20-16.1). The mesenteric SWE values of patients with a PD duration of <3 months [5.20 kPa (IQR 3.10-7.60)] were not significantly different from those of CKD patients [4.35 kPa (IQR 2.63-5.20), 
SWE could be used to non-invasively characterize peritoneal textural changes, which were closely associated with changes in peritoneal function.","['dialysate:plasma creatinine ratio', 'fluid removed', 'mesenteric elasticity', 'shear wave elastography', 'technique failure']",Clinical kidney journal,2023-02-03,"[{'lastname': 'Diao', 'firstname': 'Xiangwen', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Clinical Nephrology (Sun Yat-Sen University) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nephrology, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Yujun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Ultrasonics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Jianxiong', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Clinical Nephrology (Sun Yat-Sen University) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nephrology, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Ming', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Ultrasonics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cao', 'firstname': 'Peiyi', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Clinical Nephrology (Sun Yat-Sen University) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nephrology, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Yuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Clinical Nephrology (Sun Yat-Sen University) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nephrology, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Haishan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Clinical Nephrology (Sun Yat-Sen University) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nephrology, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Qunying', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Clinical Nephrology (Sun Yat-Sen University) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nephrology, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Fengxian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Clinical Nephrology (Sun Yat-Sen University) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nephrology, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Mao', 'firstname': 'Haiping', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Clinical Nephrology (Sun Yat-Sen University) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nephrology, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Xueqing', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'NHC Key Laboratory of Clinical Nephrology (Sun Yat-Sen University) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nephrology, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Xiaoyan', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Ultrasonics, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Xiao', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.\nNHC Key Laboratory of Clinical Nephrology (Sun Yat-Sen University) and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Nephrology, Guangzhou, China.'}]",None,None,"Of the 218 PD patients, 104 (47.8%) were male.

19293354",Review of Isoflavones and Their Potential Clinical Impacts on Cardiovascular and Bone Metabolism Markers in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.,"Cardiovascular disease is the most important cause of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease, including patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Oxidative stress, systemic and vascular inflammation, and lipid abnormalities are important causes of cardiovascular disease in these patients. Bone disorders are also a common complication in dialysis patients and can lead to bone fractures, decreased quality of life, vascular calcification, cardiovascular disease, and increased mortality. Studies in non-uremic populations have shown that soy isoflavones have beneficial effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid abnormalities, and markers of bone metabolism; however, very few studies in this field have been conducted with peritoneal dialysis patients. This paper reviews the key data regarding the effects of soy isoflavones on cardiovascular disease and bone markers and discusses the role of this nutraceutical in preventing and managing the complications of peritoneal dialysis.","['cardiovascular diseases', 'chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'isoflavones', 'mineral and bone disorder']",Preventive nutrition and food science,2023-02-02,"[{'lastname': 'Yari', 'firstname': 'Zahra', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition Research, National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute, Faculty of Nutrition Sciences and Food Technology, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 19839-63113, Iran.'}]",None,None,None,Copyright © 2022 by The Korean Society of Food Science and Nutrition.

26549852","Burden, depression and anxiety effects on family caregivers of patients with chronic kidney disease in Greece: a comparative study between dialysis modalities and kidney transplantation.","Burden of caregivers is a status that was identified as a consequence of daily care. Anxiety and depression are probably related to complex tasks interwined with the care of a family member suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD).
To examine the experienced burden, anxiety and depression of Greek caregivers of patients with End-Stage CKD on dialysis as well as kidney transplant recipients (TX) in relation to their demographic profile and to compare among the groups.
A total of 396 participants (198 couples of patients and caregivers) were recruited. Structured interviews and self-completed questionnaires were obtained from patients undergoing dialysis modalities as well as TX (28 peritoneal dialysis patients, 137 hemodialysis patients, 33 TX) and their caregivers. Zarit Burden Interview, Beck Depression Inventory and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 scales were used as screening tools.
The majority of caregivers were females (67.2%), with a median age of 58 years. Total burden was indicated as mild to moderate (Mdn = 36 (24-51)). Caregivers of haemodialysis (HD) patients showed the highest burden (Mdn = 40 (26-53)) followed by peritoneal dialysis(PD) (Mdn = 29 (25-51)) and TX group (Mdn = 28 (21-43)) (p = 0.022). Caregivers' depression and anxiety were related to the type of patients' treatment, as well. Caregivers of HD and PD patients reported significantly higher depression (Mdn = 11 (5-18)) and anxiety scores (Mdn = 3 (2-5)) in comparison to TX caregivers (Mdn = 6 (2-13) and Mdn = 2 (2-4)) (p = 0.045 and p = 0.04, respectively).
Caregivers of TX patients appeared to have less burden, depression and anxiety levels compared with caregivers of patients on dialysis modalities. Caregivers' burden is significantly associated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, gender, duration of caregiving, educational level, financial status and caregivers' age.","['Anxiety', 'Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Depression', 'Hemodialysis', 'Kidney transplantation', 'Peritoneal dialysis']",International urology and nephrology,2023-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Vovlianou', 'firstname': 'Stavroula', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece. stavroulavov@gmail.com.\nDepartment of Nephrology, General Hospital of Kavala, Kavala, Greece. stavroulavov@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Koutlas', 'firstname': 'Vasileios', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery and Transplant Unit, University Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Papoulidou', 'firstname': 'Fani', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, General Hospital of Kavala, Kavala, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Tatsis', 'firstname': 'Vasilios', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery and Transplant Unit, University Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Milionis', 'firstname': 'Haralampos', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Skapinakis', 'firstname': 'Petros', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, Ioannina, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Dounousi', 'firstname': 'Evangelia', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.\nDepartment of Surgery and Transplant Unit, University Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.'}]",None,"Caregivers of TX patients appeared to have less burden, depression and anxiety levels compared with caregivers of patients on dialysis modalities.

Little is known about the rates of a range of mental health difficulties or rates of suicide attempts in people with CKD.
Individuals with CKD (N = 268; age range 18-94 years, M = 49.96), on haemodialysis (n = 79), peritoneal dialysis (n = 46), transplant recipients (n = 84) and who were not on renal replacement therapy (RRT) (n = 59) were recruited through the Irish Kidney Association social media pages and three Irish hospitals. Participants completed surveys to gather demographics and mental health histories, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Short-form-12 to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
23.5% of participants self-reported they had received a mental health diagnosis, with depression (14.5%) and anxiety (14.2%) being the most common. 26.4% of participants had experienced suicidal ideation and 9.3% had attempted suicide. Using a clinical cut-off ≥8 on the HADS subscales, current levels of clinically significant anxiety and depression were 50.7% and 35.4%, respectively. Depression levels were slightly higher for those on haemodialysis compared to those with a transplant and those not on RRT. Depression, anxiety, and having a mental health diagnosis were all associated with lower HRQoL.
People with CKD in Ireland experience high levels of psychological distress, mental health difficulties, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts.

65,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36697297,Characteristics and technical survival of home hemodialysis in the Valencian Community (1976-2020).,"Home hemodialysis (HDD) is implemented in the Valencian Community with a higher prevalence than to the rest of the national territory, with a prevalence of 13.4 patients pmp in December 2018. We carried out an assessment of the patients characteristics and the overall and technical survival in HDD depending on the historical moment of onset and its origin.
We conducted a retrospective and descriptive study including patients of the Valencian Registry of Renal Patients from the beginning of data reported until December 2020. We calculated overall survival (combined event death-technical failure, censoring transplantation) and technical survival (event technical failure, censoring exitus and transplantation). Comparing technical survival according to the starting era: ancient (1976-2000) vs modern (2001-2020) and according to the modality of origin. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression in the total series for both overall and technical survival.
236 patients on HDD (611.4 patient-years of follow-up), mean age 49.7±16.3 years; median time of prior renal replacement therapy 0.2 years. The ratio of transplantation, death, and technical failure were 13.2, 4.4, and 7 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. In the comparison by ancient (n=57) vs modern (n=179) eras, age (37.5 vs 53.5 years), DM (3.5 vs 13.4%) and chronic tubuleinterstitial nephropathy (24.6 vs 8.9%) as a cause of chronic kidney disease were statistically significant. The probability of coming from outpatient consultation (33.3 vs 48.6%) and peritoneal dialysis (1.8 vs 12.8%) were higher in modern era with statistical significance. In the ancient era a single hospital centralized 57.9% of the patients, and in the modern era between two hospitals centralized 55.8% of the patients. Overall survival in the ancient era was 83.7% at 1year, 77.4% at 2 years, and 61% at 5 years; and in the modern era 87.3% per year, 83% 2 years and 47.8% 5 years (Log Rank 0.521). Technical survival in the ancient era was 85.4% at 1year, 79% 2 years, and 64.1% 5 years; and in the modern era 91.4% per year, 88.5% 2 years and 74.5% 5 years (Log Rank 0.195). There were no statistical differences in the comparison based on technical of provenance. In the Cox regression it was statistically significant for overall survival: the age and being diagnosed with heart disease, vascular disease or active neoplasia and for technical survival liver disease or social problem, both in univariate and multivariate.
In the modern era there is a considerable increase in HDD patients in the Valencian Community. There was a center effect in the development of HDD programs, most of the patients depended on few healthcare centers. The patients were older and had greater comorbidity in the modern era, despite this without affecting the technical and overall survival of the HDD.","['Hemodialysis', 'Hemodiálisis', 'Hemodiálisis domiciliaria', 'Home hemodialysis', 'Registro', 'Registry', 'Supervivencia técnica', 'Technical survival']",Nefrologia,2023-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Pérez Alba', 'firstname': 'Alejandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Servicio de Nefrología, Hospital General Universitario de Castellón, Castelló de la Plana, Spain.

67,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36652726,Diabetic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes: a consensus statement from the Swiss Societies of Diabetes and Nephrology.,"Diabetic kidney disease is highly prevalent in patients with type 2 diabetes and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease in Switzerland. Patients with diabetic kidney disease are among the most complex patients in diabetes care. They require a multifactorial and multidisciplinary approach with the goal to slow the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and cardiovascular morbidity. With this consensus we propose an evidence-based guidance to health care providers involved in the care of type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic kidney disease.First, there is a need to increase physician awareness and improve screening for diabetic kidney disease as early intervention may improve clinical outcomes and the financial burden. Evaluation of estimated GFR (eGFR) and spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio is recommended at least annually. Once it is diagnosed, glucose control and optimisation of blood pressure control with renin-angiotensin system blockers have been recommended as mainstay management of diabetic kidney disease for more than 20 years. Recent, high quality randomised controlled trials have shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition slows eGFR decline and cardiovascular events beyond glucose control. Likewise, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism with finerenone has cardiorenal protective effects in diabetic kidney disease. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) receptor agonists improve weight loss if needed, and decrease albuminuria and cardiovascular morbidity. Lipid control is also important to decrease cardiovascular events. All these therapies are included in the treatment algorithms proposed in this consensus. With advancing kidney failure, other challenges may rise, such as hyperkalaemia, anaemia and metabolic acidosis, as well as chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder. These different topics and treatment strategies are discussed in this consensus. Finally, an update on diabetes management in renal replacement therapy such as haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and renal transplantation is provided. With the recent developments of efficient therapies for diabetic kidney disease, it has become evident that a consensus document is necessary. We are optimistic that it will significantly contribute to a high-quality care for patients with diabetic kidney disease in Switzerland in the future.",[],Swiss medical weekly,2023-01-19,"[{'lastname': 'Zanchi', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Service of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.\nService of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Jehle', 'firstname': 'Andreas W', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hirslanden Klinik St. Anna, Lucerne, Switzerland.\nTransplantation Immunology and Nephrology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lamine', 'firstname': 'Faiza', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Service of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.\nUnit of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Riviera-Chablais Hospital (HRC), Rennaz, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Vogt', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Czerlau', 'firstname': 'Cecilia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Bilz', 'firstname': 'Stefan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine and Endocrinology, Kantonsspital St Gallen, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Seeger', 'firstname': 'Harald', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'de Seigneux', 'firstname': 'Sophie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Service of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Medicine, Geneva University Hospital, Switzerland.'}]",None,None,None,None,10.57187/smw.2023.40004,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17e47a020>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,36652726,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36652726,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

29961059",The role of residual renal function on potassium intake and excretion in patients on peritoneal dialysis.,"Patients on chronic dialysis are at increased risk of developing disorders in potassium balance. The preservation of residual renal function (RRF), frequently observed in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), may contribute to better control of serum potassium. This study aimed to investigate the role residual renal function on potassium intake and excretion in PD patients.
In this cross-sectional study, dietary potassium was evaluated by the 3-day food record. Potassium concentration was determined in serum, 24 h dialysate, stool ample, and 24 h urine of patients with diuresis > 200 mL/day, who were considered non-anuric.
Fifty-two patients, 50% men, 52.6 ± 14.0 years, and PD vintage 19.5 [7.0-44.2] months, were enrolled. Compared to the anuric group (n = 17, 33%), the non-anuric group (n = 35, 67%) had lower dialysate potassium excretion (24.8 ± 5.3 vs 30.9 ± 5.9 mEq/d; p = 0.001), higher total potassium intake (44.5 ± 16.7 vs 35.1 ± 8.1 mEq/d; p = 0.009) and potassium intake from fruit (6.2 [2.4-14.7] vs 2.9 [0.0-6.0]mEq/d; p = 0.018), and no difference in serum potassium (4.8 ± 0.6 vs 4.8 ± 0.9 mEq/L; p = 0.799) and fecal potassium (2.2 ± 0.5 vs 2.1 ± 0.7 mEq/L; p = 0.712). In non-anuric patients, potassium intake correlated directly with urinary potassium (r = 0.40; p = 0.017), but not with serum, dialysate, or fecal potassium. In the anuric group, potassium intake tended to correlate positively with serum potassium (r = 0.48; p = 0.051) and there was no correlation with dialysate or fecal potassium.
The presence of residual renal function constitutes an important factor in the excretion of potassium, which may allow the adoption of a less-restrictive diet.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Diet', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Potassium', 'Residual renal function']",International urology and nephrology,2023-01-18,"[{'lastname': 'Claudino', 'firstname': 'Gabriele', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramos', 'firstname': 'Christiane Ishikawa', 'initials': 'CI', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'de Andrade', 'firstname': 'Laila Santos', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Nutrition Program, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'Natalia Barros Ferreira', 'initials': 'NBF', 'affiliation': 'Nutrition Program, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Teixeira', 'firstname': 'Renata Rodrigues', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': 'Nutrition Program, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Muniz', 'firstname': 'Gisselma Aliny Santos', 'initials': 'GAS', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Di Medeiros Leal', 'firstname': 'Maria Carolina Bezerra', 'initials': 'MCB', 'affiliation': 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, Universidade Federal de São Carlos, São Carlos, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Cuppari', 'firstname': 'Lilian', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. lcuppari@uol.com.br.\nNutrition Program, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. lcuppari@uol.com.br.'}]",None,"The presence of residual renal function constitutes an important factor in the excretion of potassium, which may allow the adoption of a less-restrictive diet.","Fifty-two patients, 50% men, 52.6 ± 14.0 years, and PD vintage 19.5 [7.0-44.2] months, were enrolled.

69,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36646184,The impact of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis: A cohort study in China.,"There is increasing evidence for an association of air pollutants and the incidence of chronic kidney disease, and the progression to end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Despite the global expansion of peritoneal dialysis (PD), the impact of environmental and climatic factors in PD patients has not been studied in detail. We aimed to assess the association of long-term residential exposure to air pollutants, with patient survival and incidence of hospitalizations. This was a cohort study of all prevalent ESKD patients who were stable on PD therapy for more than 90 days in our PD center from 2013/01/01 to 2018/12/31. The enrolled patients were followed until death, cessation of PD, loss to follow-up, or 2018/12/31. Time-varying pollutant exposures were modeled as the key time-dependent variables. We used time-dependent Cox model to evaluate the risk of mortality and hospitalizations associated with air pollutant exposures adjusted for potential confounders. A total of 886 subjects who meets inclusion criteria with 27,024 patient-months were modeled. Over a mean follow-up of 30.5 ± 21.3 months, we ascertained 246 cases of death and 2611 cases of hospital admission.

We evaluated the effect of the achievement of glycated hemoglobin A
In a nationwide registry of all individuals diagnosed with diabetes assisted by the health system in Colombia, we analyzed the association between baseline or sustained goal achievement and development of iCKD over a 4-year follow-up. iCKD was defined as a new occurrence of an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m
The study included 998 790 adults with diabetes (56% female, mean age 59). There were 125 626 cases of iCKD. After adjustment for multiple confounders, a baseline SBP less than 130 mm Hg (odds ratio [OR] 0.79 [0.78-0.80]) and a baseline HbA

72,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36622442,Gutted: constipation in children with chronic kidney disease and on dialysis.,"Functional constipation is a common problem in otherwise healthy children. Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and on dialysis have additional disease-related risk factors including the uremic milieu, fluid and dietary restrictions, and decreased physical activity, as well as treatment-related risk factors such as dialysis therapy and polypharmacy that contribute to and compound the problem. Constipation causes significant distress for children and their caregivers. In children on peritoneal dialysis, severe constipation can impede catheter function and ultrafiltration. Accumulating evidence points to a possible bidirectional relationship between constipation and CKD, potentially mediated by gut dysbiosis with consequent increased generation of gut-derived uremic toxins and disruption of intestinal epithelium integrity leading to translocation of noxious luminal contents into the circulation inducing systemic inflammation. Effective management of constipation is required but there is little published data on the safety and effectiveness of treatments in adults or children with CKD. In this review, we discuss the diagnosis and epidemiology of functional constipation, provide an overview of its pathophysiology, summarize the therapeutic management, and reflect on the challenges in children with CKD.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Constipation', 'Dialysis', 'Gut microbiota', 'Laxative']","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2023-01-10,"[{'lastname': 'Wan', 'firstname': 'Mandy', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Evelina Pharmacy Department, Evelina London Children's Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust, Guy's and St ThomasWestminster Bridge Road, London, SE1 7EH, UK. mandy.wan@gstt.nhs.uk.\nInstitute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London, London, UK. mandy.wan@gstt.nhs.uk.""}, {'lastname': 'King', 'firstname': 'Lillian', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and Institute of Child Health, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Baugh', 'firstname': 'Natasha', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and Institute of Child Health, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Arslan', 'firstname': 'Zainab', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and Institute of Child Health, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Snauwaert', 'firstname': 'Evelien', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Paglialonga', 'firstname': 'Fabio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Shroff', 'firstname': 'Rukshana', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and Institute of Child Health, London, UK.'}]",None,None,None,© 2023.

11169029",Relationship between Residual Urine Output and Type of Dialysis with FGF23 Levels.,"Several studies investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) in the regulation of renal phosphate excretion in chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, patients with residual urine output (UO) seem to control their serum phosphorus levels better. Our aim was to determine whether FGF23 levels are influenced by dialysis modality and UO. We performed a cross-sectional study in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The C-terminal FGF23 (cFGF23) levels were determined in plasma with a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The UO collection referred to an mL/day measurement. All p values were two-sided, and the statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. We enrolled 133 patients (58 HD, 75 PD, UO 70%). The median cFGF23 was significantly higher in HD vs. PD patients (p = 0.0017) and not significantly higher in patients without UO (p = 0.12). We found a negative correlation between cFGF23 and the UO volume (p = 0.0250), but the correlation was not significant when considering the type of dialysis treatment. Phosphorus (ß = 0.21677; p = 0.0007), type of dialysis (ß = −0.68392; p = 0.0003), and creatinine (ß = 0.08130; p = 0.0133) were significant and independent predictors of cFGF23 levels. In conclusion, cFGF23 was significantly higher in HD than in PD patients. We found a significant negative correlation between cFGF23 and the residual UO volume, but the correlation was not significant considering the type of dialysis. Our study reveals that dialysis modality is an independent predictor of FGF23 levels. In particular, PD is associated with lower FGF23 levels than HD.","['chronic kidney disease (CKD)', 'fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23)', 'hemodialysis (HD)', 'hyperphosphatemia', 'peritoneal dialysis (PD)', 'residual urine output (UO)']",Journal of clinical medicine,2023-01-09,"[{'lastname': 'Corradi', 'firstname': 'Valentina', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation, San Bortolo Hospital, AULSS 8 BERICA Vicenza, 36100 Vicenza, Italy.\nInternational Renal Research Institute of Vicenza and IRRIV Foundation for Research, San Bortolo Hospital, AULSS 8 BERICA Vicenza, 36100 Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Samoni', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza and IRRIV Foundation for Research, San Bortolo Hospital, AULSS 8 BERICA Vicenza, 36100 Vicenza, Italy.\nDepartment of Nephrology and Dialysis, S.

17785025",Effect of remote patient monitoring for patients with chronic kidney disease who perform dialysis at home: a systematic review.,"The purpose of the systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of remote patient monitoring (RPM) follow-up compared with standard care, for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who perform dialysis at home.
We conducted a systematic review in accordance with international guidelines. We performed systematic searches for publications from 2015 to 2021 in five databases (eg, Medline, Cinahl, Embase) and a search for grey literature in reference lists. Included effect measures were quality of life, hospitalisation, technical failure as the cause for transfer to a different dialysis modality, infections and time patients use for travel. Screening of literature, data extraction, risk-of-bias assessment and certainty of evidence assessment (using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach) were done by two researchers. We conducted meta-analyses when possible.
Seven studies met the inclusion criteria, of which two were randomised controlled trials and five were retrospective cohort studies with control groups. The studies included 9975 participants from 5 countries, who were a good representation of dialysis patients in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. The patients were on peritoneal dialysis (six studies) or home haemodialysis (one study). There was very low certainty of evidence for the outcomes, except for hospitalisations: there was low certainty evidence from three cohort studies for fewer hospitalisation days in the RPM group. No studies included data for time patients used for travel.
We found low to very low certainty evidence that indicate there may be positive effects of RPM follow-up, in comparison to standard care only, for adult patients with CKD who perform dialysis at home. Offering RPM follow-up for home dialysis patients as an alternative or supplement to standard care appears to be safe and provide health benefits such as fewer hospitalisation days. Future implementation should be coupled with robust, high-quality evaluations.

20705950",N-Acetylcysteine: more than preventing contrast-induced nephropathy in uremic patients-focus on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.,"Oxidative stress (OS) has been recognized as a pathophysiologic mechanism underlying the development and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). OS, which results from the disturbance of balance among pro-oxidants and antioxidants favoring the pro-oxidants, is present even in early CKD and increases progressively along with deterioration of kidney function to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). In ESKD, OS is further exacerbated mainly due to dialysis procedures per se and predisposes to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, since OS plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis in uremic patients, several strategies aiming to ameliorate OS in these patients have been proposed. Among those, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a thiol-containing antioxidant agent, has attracted special attention due to its pleiotropic functions and beneficial effect in various OS-related entities including paracetamol overdose and prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy. In this review, we present the currently available literature on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of NAC in CKD, including hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.","['Antioxidants', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'End-stage renal disease', 'Inflammation', 'N-Acetylcysteine', 'Oxidative stress', 'Renal replacement therapy']",International urology and nephrology,2023-01-03,"[{'lastname': 'Cepaityte', 'firstname': 'Dainora', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Dialysis Unit, General Hospital of Serres, 62120, Serres, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Leivaditis', 'firstname': 'Konstantinos', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, 1st Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, AHEPA Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54636, Thessaloniki, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Varouktsi', 'firstname': 'Garyfallia', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, 1st Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, AHEPA Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54636, Thessaloniki, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Roumeliotis', 'firstname': 'Athanasios', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, 1st Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, AHEPA Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54636, Thessaloniki, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Roumeliotis', 'firstname': 'Stefanos', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, 1st Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, AHEPA Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54636, Thessaloniki, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Liakopoulos', 'firstname': 'Vassilios', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, 1st Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, AHEPA Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54636, Thessaloniki, Greece. liakopul@otenet.gr.'}]",None,None,None,© 2023.

24937533",Influencing factors of serum magnesium in CKD5 patients: A multicenter study in southern China.,"Magnesium (Mg) disturbances are related to cardiac, bone, and renal patient mortality. In this study, we compared biochemical markers in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and explored the influencing factors of serum Mg in stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD5) patients.
All 598 patients with CKD5 from three medical centers in South China were recruited into this prospective cohort study from March 1, 2018, to January 31, 2021. Our study recorded the clinical characteristics and laboratory data of the patients.
Hemodialysis patients (0.99 ± 0.19 mmol/L) had a higher mean serum Mg level than PD patients (0.86 ± 0.20 mmol/L; 
This multicenter study in southern China showed that for all CKD5 patients, corrected Ca and Alb had a significant positive effect on serum Mg, while Ca/Mg had a significant negative effect on serum Mg. In 123 HD patients, Ca × P was positively associated with Mg while Ca/Mg and P were negatively associated with Mg. In 398 PD patients, Ca × P, Alb, and total protein were positively associated with Mg while Ca/Mg and P were negatively associated with Mg. In 77 non-dialysis patients, corrected Ca, Cr, and total protein were positively associated with Mg while Ca/Mg was negatively associated with Mg. Furthermore, Ca/Mg might be another useful technique to monitor blood Mg levels in CKD5 patients.

Phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study.
Patients aged 3 months to 17 years with renal anemia and chronic kidney disease (CKD; including those treated with maintenance dialysis and those not treated with dialysis) who were receiving maintenance treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs).
Subcutaneous C.E.R.A. administration every 4 weeks (starting dose was based on defined conversion factors).
The primary outcome was the change in hemoglobin concentration between the baseline and evaluation period for each patient. Secondary efficacy measures and safety were also evaluated.
Forty patients aged 0.4-17.7 years were enrolled. The study achieved its primary outcome: the mean change in hemoglobin concentration was an increase of 0.48g/dL; the 95% confidence interval (0.15-0.82) and standard deviation (±1.03) were within the prespecified boundaries (-1 to 1g/dL and<1.5g/dL, respectively). Mean hemoglobin concentrations were maintained within the target 10-12g/dL range in 24 of 38 patients and within±1g/dL of the baseline in 19 of 38 patients, and the median C.E.R.A. subcutaneous dose decreased over time. Efficacy in key subgroups (age group, dialysis type, prior ESA treatment) was consistent with the primary outcome. Thirty-eight patients completed the core period; 25 chose to enter the safety extension period. Safety was consistent with prior studies, with no new signals.
Single-arm and open-label study; small sample size.
Pediatric patients with anemia secondary to CKD who were on, or not on, dialysis could be safely and effectively switched from maintenance ESAs to subcutaneous C.E.R.A. administered every 4 weeks, using defined dose-conversion factors to determine the optimum starting dose.

The SKIPPER trial registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with study number NCT03552393.
Anemia, a complication of chronic kidney disease, is associated with poor quality of life and an increased risk of hospitalization and mortality. The current treatments for anemia include iron therapy and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs); however, the relatively short half-lives of the ESAs epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa may require more frequent dosing and hospital visits compared with the ESA known as continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A.). A previous study demonstrated that children aged 5 years or more with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease who were on hemodialysis could be switched to intravenous C.E.R.A. from their existing epoetin alfa/beta or darbepoetin alfa treatment. This study provides evidence that subcutaneous C.E.R.A. can safely and effectively treat anemia in children, including those aged<5 years and regardless of whether they were on dialysis or the type of dialysis they received (peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis).","['Anemia', 'Mircera', 'chronic kidney disease (CKD)', 'continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (C.E.R.A.)', 'dialysis', 'drug dosing', 'erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA)', 'hemoglobin', 'injection pain', 'methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta', 'pediatric', 'subcutaneous']",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2023-01-02,"[{'lastname': 'Warady', 'firstname': 'Bradley A', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': ""Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Children's Mercy Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri.

34753894",Availability and prioritisation of COVID-19 vaccines among patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and kidney failure during the height of the pandemic: a global survey by the International Society of Nephrology.,"Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) or kidney failure receiving replacement therapy (KFRT) are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, morbidity and mortality. Vaccination is effective, but access differs around the world. We aimed to ascertain the availability, readiness and prioritisation of COVID-19 vaccines for this group of patients globally.
Collaborators from the International Society of Nephrology (ISN), Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study and ISN-Global Kidney Health Atlas developed an online survey that was administered electronically to key nephrology leaders in 174 countries between 2 July and 4 August 2021.
Survey responses were received from 99 of 174 countries from all 10 ISN regions, among which 88/174 (50%) were complete. At least one vaccine was available in 96/99 (97%) countries. In 71% of the countries surveyed, patients on dialysis were prioritised for vaccination, followed by patients living with a kidney transplant (KT) (62%) and stage 4/5 CKD (51%). Healthcare workers were the most common high priority group for vaccination. At least 50% of patients receiving in-centre haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or KT were estimated to have completed vaccination at the time of the survey in 55%, 64% and 51% of countries, respectively. At least 50% of patients in all three patient groups had been vaccinated in >70% of high-income countries and in 100% of respondent countries in Western Europe.The most common barriers to vaccination of patients were vaccine hesitancy (74%), vaccine shortages (61%) and mass vaccine distribution challenges (48%). These were reported more in low-income and lower middle-income countries compared with high-income countries.
Patients with advanced CKD or KFRT were prioritised in COVID-19 vaccination in most countries. Multiple barriers led to substantial variability in the successful achievement of COVID-19 vaccination across the world, with high-income countries achieving the most access and success.","['COVID-19', 'dialysis', 'epidemiology', 'health policy', 'renal transplantation']",BMJ open,2022-12-31,"[{'lastname': 'Wijewickrama', 'firstname': 'Eranga S', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, Colombo, Sri Lanka.'}, {'lastname': 'Abdul Hafidz', 'firstname': 'Muhammad Iqbal', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Unit, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), Selangor, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Robinson', 'firstname': 'Bruce M', 'initials': 'BM', 'affiliation': 'University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'David W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kidney and Transplant Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Liew', 'firstname': 'Adrian', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Dreyer', 'firstname': 'Gavin', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Renal Medicine, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Caskey', 'firstname': 'Fergus J', 'initials': 'FJ', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bello', 'firstname': 'Aminu K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Zaidi', 'firstname': 'Deenaz', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Damster', 'firstname': 'Sandrine', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'International Society of Nephrology, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Salaro', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'International Society of Nephrology, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Luyckx', 'firstname': 'Valerie Ann', 'initials': 'VA', 'affiliation': ""Nephrology, University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.\nDepartment of Paediatrics and Child Heath, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.\nRenal Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Bajpai', 'firstname': 'Divya', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Seth GS Medical College and KEM Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India divyaa24@gmail.com.'}]",None,"Patients with advanced CKD or KFRT were prioritised in COVID-19 vaccination in most countries.

33181358","Neisseria elongata -mediated peritonitis in an end-stage renal disease patient on automated peritoneal dialysis, A case report and literature review.","Peritoneal dialysis (PD) can result in peritonitis, which frequently causes severe and near-fatal clinical implications if left untreated. Usually, Gram-positive bacteria are the most common organisms involved. Uncommonly recognized as the cause of peritonitis in PD patients, Neisseria Elongata is a gram-negative nasal and oropharyngeal normal flora organism.
We report a rare case of a 29-year-old man who had received automated peritoneal dialysis for six years and had Neisseria Elongata peritonitis.
Several case Reports of niseria-related peritonitis may point to the potential pathogenicity of such organisms and suggest that many cases of culture-negative peritonitis may have been misdiagnosed.

14962849",Acute Kidney Injury Complicating Severe Acute Pancreatitis: Clinical Profile and Factors Predicting Mortality.,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently complicates severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) among the critically ill. We studied clinical profile and risk factors predicting mortality in SAP-AKI.
We conducted a prospective observational study of 68 patients with SAP-AKI from September 2015 to September 2019. Patient data and outcomes grouped as survivors and deceased were analyzed.
SAP-AKI constituted 2.14% (68 of 3,169) of all AKIs with 1.5%, 20.6%, and 77.9% in Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Stages I, II and III respectively. The mean age was 39.93 ± 11.79 years with males 65 (95.6%). The causes of acute pancreatitis were alcohol addiction 59 (86.8%), highly active antiretroviral therapy 1 (1.4%), hypercalcemia 1 (1.4%), IgG4-related disease 1 (1.4%), and unidentified 6 (8.8%). Complications were volume overload, shock, respiratory failure, and necrotizing pancreatitis in 21 (30.9%), 10 (14.7%), 6 (8.8%), and 14 (20.5%), respectively. Kidney replacement therapy done in 40 (58%), with intermittent hemodialysis 36 (53%) and acute intermittent peritoneal dialysis 4 (6%). The overall mortality was 23 (33.8%), three progressed to chronic kidney disease (thrombotic microangiopathy 2; biopsy inconclusive 1). In 45 survivors, AKI recovered in 22.7 ± 9.6 days. Death occurred within first 6 days. The risk factors associated with in-hospital mortality was necrotizing pancreatitis (odds ratio [OR] = 5.143; 95% confidence interval 1.472-17.972; 
Alcohol addiction was the commonest cause of severe acute pancreatitis. The overall mortality was 33.8%. Necrotizing pancreatitis, circulatory failure, peak creatinine >3 mg/dL, BISAPs >3, KDIGO III, and the need for kidney replacement therapy were independent risk factors for mortality.","['Acute kidney injury', 'BISAP score', 'kidney replacement therapy', 'severe acute pancreatitis', 'thrombotic microangiopathy']",Indian journal of nephrology,2022-12-27,"[{'lastname': 'Selvanathan', 'firstname': 'Deepak Kumar', 'initials': 'DK', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nephrology, Madras Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Prem Geovanni', 'initials': 'PG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Madurai Medical College, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Thanikachalam', 'firstname': 'Dinesh Kumar', 'initials': 'DK', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nephrology, Madras Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Rajendran', 'firstname': 'Padmaraj', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nephrology, Madras Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Gopalakrishnan', 'firstname': 'Natarajan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Nephrology, Madras Medical College, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.'}]",None,None,"SAP-AKI constituted 2.14% (68 of 3,169) of all AKIs with 1.5%, 20.6%, and 77.9% in Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Stages I, II and III respectively.

Adaptation of the international consortium for health outcomes measurement standard set to the Spanish setting.,"We aim to adapt the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurements standard set for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients to the Spanish setting and supplement it with those variables agreed upon through initiatives proposed by the Spanish Society of Nephrologists (S.E.N.).
The working group defined a first standard set of variables based on a literature review. The S.E.N. members then assessed the suitability of each variable for inclusion (Consensus≥75%). A second draft of the standard set was generated and evaluated by the Patient advocacy group Federación Nacional de Asociaciones para la Lucha Contra las Enfermedades del Riñón (ALCER). Lastly, the working group established the final standard set of variables (Consensus≥75%).
The standard set targets patients with very high-risk CKD (G3a/A3 and G3b/A2-G5) in pre-end-stage kidney disease (pre-ESKD), hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), kidney transplantation (KT) or conservative care (CC). The essential follow-up variables agreed for all patients (All) were patient survival, hospitalizations, cardiovascular events, smoking status, health-related quality of life, pain, fatigue, physical function, daily activities, depression, renal function and hemoglobin. Additionally, it was agreed to collect PD survival (in PD patients), peritonitis (PD), infection/bacteremia (PD, HD, KT), vascular access type (HD), vascular access survival (HD), acute rejection (KT), post-transplant cancer (KT), albuminuria (KT) and kidney allograft survival (KT). The optional variables agreed were phosphorus (All), potassium (All), diabetes control (All with diabetes), and albuminuria (pre-ESKD).
This standard set may constitute a highly efficient tool allowing the evaluation of patient outcomes and helping to define strategies to enhance CKD patients' quality of care in the Spanish healthcare system.","['Atención centrada en el paciente', 'CKD', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Enfermedad renal crónica', 'Estándar de atención', 'Medidas de resultado informadas por el paciente', 'Patient-centered care', 'Patient-reported outcome measures', 'Standard of care']",Nefrologia,2022-12-24,"[{'lastname': 'Parra', 'firstname': 'Eduardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, Spain.

83,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36549655,Effect of residual kidney function and dialysis adequacy on chronic pruritus in dialysis patients.,"Chronic Kidney Disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) is common in dialysis patients, associated with lower quality of life and increased risk of death. We investigated the association between residual eGFR, dialysis adequacy or serum phosphate level and CKD-aP in incident dialysis patients.
1256 incident hemodialysis (HD) and 670 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients (>18y) from the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis study were included (1997-2007) and followed until death, transplantation, or max 10y. CKD-aP was measured using a single item of the KDQOL-36. The associations were studied by logistic and linear regression analyses, adjusted for potential baseline confounders.
At baseline mean (SD) age was 60 (16), 62% were men and median (IQR) residual eGFR was 3.4 (1.7-5.3) ml/min/1.73m2. The prevalence of CKD-aP (∼70%) was similar in HD and PD. It was observed that 12 months after starting dialysis (after multivariable adjustment) each 1 ml/min/1.73m2 higher residual eGFR, one unit higher total weekly Kt/V, or 1 mmol/L lower serum phosphate level was associated with lower burden of CKD-aP in HD and PD patients of -0.05 (95%CI:-0.09;-0.02) and -0.09 (95%CI:-0.13;-0.05), -0.15 (95%CI:-0.26;-0.05) and -0.35 (95%CI:-0.54;-0.16), and of -0.34 (95%CI:-0.17;-0.51) and -0.45 (95%CI:-0.19;-0.71), respectively. We found no association between dialysis Kt/V and CKD-aP.
Higher residual eGFR and lower serum phosphate level, but not the dialysis dose, were related with lower burden of CKD-aP in dialysis patients.","['dialysis', 'dialysis adequacy', 'itching', 'pruritus', 'residual kidney function']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2022-12-23,"[{'lastname': 'Lengton', 'firstname': 'Robin', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Willik', 'firstname': 'Esmee M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'de Rooij', 'firstname': 'Esther N M', 'initials': 'ENM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Meuleman', 'firstname': 'Yvette', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Cessie', 'firstname': 'Saskia Le', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.\nSection Medical Statistics, Department of Biomedical Datasciences, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Michels', 'firstname': 'Wieneke M', 'initials': 'WM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Hemmelder', 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, division of Nephrology, Maastricht University Medical Centre and CARIM research school for cardiovascular disease, Maastricht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Dekker', 'firstname': 'Friedo W', 'initials': 'FW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoogeveen', 'firstname': 'Ellen K', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Jeroen Bosch Hospital, den Bosch, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,"At baseline mean (SD) age was 60 (16), 62% were men and median (IQR) residual eGFR was 3.4 (1.7-5.3) ml/min/1.73m2.

General clinical information, etiological categories, and hospitalization costs for HD or PD were collected from 1,515 patients hospitalized with stage 5 CKD at the Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University from 2016 to 2018. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the independent influencing factors affecting patients' financial burden.
The highest rate of DN was found in patients aged 70 years or older (27.0%) and the highest incidence of primary glomerulopathy was found in patients aged <50 years (24.3%). Age, type of dialysis, and type of health insurance were independent influences on the total financial burden of patients, and the results of multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that age [OR (95% CI): 1.009 (1.002, 1.020)] and type of dialysis [OR (95% CI): 1.746 (1.149, 2.659)] would increase the total financial burden.

27875808",Comparison of soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 and brachial hemodynamic parameters between dialysis modalities in patients with end-stage kidney disease.,"Major cardiovascular events (MACE) are the leading cause of mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) are comparable in survival, patients with HD have a significantly higher risk of developing MACE. Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2) is a cardiac biomarker, that does not vary with age, gender, and kidney function. This study aimed to compare arterial stiffness, fluid status, and sST2 levels, between patients with PD and those with in-center HD.
This was a cross-sectional study, which was conducted with 36 PD patients, 36 HD patients, and 36 age, and gender-matched healthy controls. We used noninvasive methods for the assessment of arterial stiffness and fluid status.
The patients with PD overhydrated compared to HD patients and healthy control (p < 0.001, and p = 0.05, respectively). Patients with PD had higher central systolic blood pressure and central pulse pressure than patients with HD and the control group (p = 0.004, and p = 0.01; p < 0.001, and p = 0.004, respectively). HD patients had a significantly higher level of plasma sST2 level compared to PD patients and the control group (p = 0.03, and p = 0.005). HD as maintenance dialysis modality and dialysis vintage was associated with higher plasma sST2 concentration, and having a residual renal function in dialysis patients was related to the lower plasma sST2 concentration.
PD is associated with better sST2 levels even though higher volume load than HD. In addition, the loss of RRF may be the most important factor related to increased sST2.","['Bioimpedance spectroscopy', 'Hemodialysis', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Pulse wave velocity', 'Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2']",International urology and nephrology,2022-12-19,"[{'lastname': 'Yeter', 'firstname': 'Hacı Hasan', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Clinic, Sivas Numune State Hospital, TR58000, Sivas, Turkey. hasanyeter@hotmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Karacalik', 'firstname': 'Ceren', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine Clinic, Mus State Hospital, Mus, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Eraslan', 'firstname': 'Esra', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine Clinic, Yozgat State Hospital, Yozgat, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Durantas', 'firstname': 'Halil', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine Clinic, Halil Sivgin Cubuk State Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Akcay', 'firstname': 'Omer Faruk', 'initials': 'OF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Derici', 'firstname': 'Kursat', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Kırıkkale University, Kirikkale, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Derici', 'firstname': 'Ulver', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.'}]",None,"PD is associated with better sST2 levels even though higher volume load than HD.

In this study, we aimed to compare serum irisin level in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD).
Two hundred and fifty-two dialysis patients (146 PD patients and 106 HD patients) were included in the study. Levels of serum irisin and other parameters were compared between the two groups' patients.
There were higher serum irisin levels in PD patients than those in HD patients [113.10 (106.15 ~ 119.15) ng/ml vs. 45.72(21.67 ~ 79.71) ng/ml, P < 0.001]. Moreover, body fat mass, percent body fat, serum calcium, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, carbon dioxide combining power (CO

He also received piperacillin-tazobactam and amikacin for 7 days for suspected early-onset neonatal sepsis. He developed anuria and raised creatinine and was referred with acute kidney injury (AKI)-neonatal KDIGO (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) stage 3 on day 20. Urine output and renal parameters improved after discontinuing drugs and peritoneal dialysis. This case report highlights the importance of serial monitoring of kidney function tests while using nephrotoxic drugs and ensuring correct dosage and titration. In the early stages, AKI can be treated with conservative therapy but once established, renal replacement therapy might be required. It can also lead to chronic kidney disease.","['Contraindications and precautions', 'Neonatal intensive care']",BMJ case reports,2022-12-17,"[{'lastname': 'Mishra', 'firstname': 'Purbasha', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neonatology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kar', 'firstname': 'Shrutiprajna', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neonatology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Som', 'firstname': 'Tapas Kumar', 'initials': 'TK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neonatology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Devi', 'firstname': 'Usha', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neonatology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India dr.ushaa@gmail.com.'}]",None,None,None,© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2022.

88,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36477316,Survival of patients on chronic hemodialysis versus chronic peritoneal dialysis.,"To compare the survival of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) versus peritoneal dialysis (PD).
Survival analysis of a retrospective cohort of patients ≥ 18 years who started HD versus PD at the Victor Lazarte Echegaray Hospital from 2015 to 2019. We analyzed the following covariates: age, sex, diabetes mellitus as cause of CKD, temporary central venous catheter (CVC) as initial vascular access and glomerular filtration rate. Survival was calculated with Kaplan-Meier curves for the overall cohort and for age ≥ 60 years, diabetes mellitus as a cause of CKD and CVC. The risk of death was estimated by Hazard Ratio (HR) according to the Cox proportional hazards model for each covariate adjusted for dialysis type in a bivariate and multivariate analysis considering significant difference if the p-value < 0.05.
We included 368 patients on HD of whom 129 (35.1%) died, and 172 patients on PD of whom 66 (38.4%) died (p=0.455). The cumulative probability of survival at 60 months for HD was 30% and for PD was 37% with similar survival curves (p=0.719). The median survival time for HD was 32 months (IQR: 20-53) and for PD was 32.5 months (IQR: 18-57) (p=0.999). The covariates associated with higher mortality adjusted for dialysis type were age ≥60 years (HR 1.77; p<0.001) and diabetes mellitus as a cause of CKD (HR 1.63; p=0.002).
Survival of patients with CKD on HD and PD was similar.

Renal transplant recipients have an increased risk of developing RCC. RCC development after kidney transplantation is very rarely reported in children. We present a 11-year-old boy who had cadaveric kidney transplantation for kidney failure 2 years ago. He was under immunosuppressive therapy and presented with microscopic hematuria. An ultrasound (US) revealed bilateral solid renal masses. Further cross-sectional imaging showed a 60 × 70 × 60-mm right renal mass with claw sign and a 5 × 6 × 6-mm mass in the left renal lower pole. A bilateral radical nephroureterectomy of native kidneys was performed. The pathology revealed bilateral papillary RCC without TFE3 upregulation. The patient was kept on low-dose immunosuppressive therapy in the perioperative period. He received no chemotherapy but a close radiological surveillance was undertaken. He is tumor-free 2 years after the operation. RCC is a rare tumor for children and bilateralism is even rarer. The child had a history of chronic kidney disease, peritoneal dialysis, and immunosuppressive therapy. As there are no standardized protocols regarding imaging in transplanted kidneys routine surveillance, US follow-up should also focus on detecting malignancy.","['bilateral', 'child', 'native kidney', 'renal cell carcinoma', 'transplantation']",European journal of pediatric surgery reports,2022-12-08,"[{'lastname': 'Durakbaşa', 'firstname': 'Çiğdem Ulukaya', 'initials': 'ÇU', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Istanbul Medeniyet University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.\nDepartment of Pediatric Surgery, Goztepe Prof Dr Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Ugurlu', 'firstname': 'Deniz', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Istanbul Medeniyet University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Bozbeyoglu', 'firstname': 'Sabriye Gulcin', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Goztepe Prof Dr Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Aydoner', 'firstname': 'Sinem', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Istanbul Medeniyet University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Seneldir', 'firstname': 'Hatice', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Istanbul Medeniyet University Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Candir', 'firstname': 'Mehmet Onur', 'initials': 'MO', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Goztepe Prof Dr Suleyman Yalcin City Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Candan', 'firstname': 'Cengiz', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Istanbul Medeniyet University Faculty of Medicine, Uskudar, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Gemici', 'firstname': 'Atilla', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Baskent University Istanbul Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.'}]",None,None,None,"The Author(s).

90,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36457294,Safe administration of temozolomide in end-stage renal disease patients.,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive type of central nervous system tumor. We present a novel case of the challenges of dosing temozolomide in a patient with end stage renal disease on peritoneal hemodialysis with unpredictable clearance and toxicities.
In this case, a 60-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension and Stage V chronic kidney disease presented with worsening confusion and word-finding difficulty in the emergency department. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large intra-axial mass within the posterior left frontal lobe measuring 4.5 × 4.1 × 3.5 cm with irregularly, predominant peripheral tumoral enhancement.
The patient underwent a surgical resection which confirmed the diagnosis of glioblastoma (grade 4). The standard treatment for glioblastoma is 6 weeks of radiation therapy and daily temozolomide. Given his history of renal dysfunction and limited data on the safety of temozolomide in patients on hemodialysis (HD), the patient was administered dose-reduced temozolomide and closely monitored for toxicities. Temozolomide was successfully up-titrated to the full dose.
Renal replacement therapy is a life-saving treatment for end-stage kidney disease patients. A stepwise increase in the dosage of temozolomide did not increase the risk of toxicity with HD. There are no studies with patients on temozolomide and peritoneal dialysis. Our case transitioned to peritoneal dialysis from HD without significant toxicity from temozolomide. As a more substantial proportion of the population becomes dialysis-dependent in the coming years, we need further studies to understand the safety profiles of chemotherapeutic agents in this complex subset of patients.","['Neurooncology', 'end-stage renal disease', 'glioblastoma', 'treatment']",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,2022-12-03,"[{'lastname': 'Hundal', 'firstname': 'Jasmin', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Singh', 'firstname': 'Aditi', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'Megan K', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Hematology and Oncology Department, Saint Francis Hospital, Hartford, CT, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vredenburg', 'firstname': 'James', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Hematology and Oncology Department, Saint Francis Hospital, Hartford, CT, USA.'}]",None,None,None,None,10.1177/10781552221131908,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17e652cf0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,36457294,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36457294,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

To estimate the prevalence of HBV, HCV, and HIV coinfection and to explore factors associated with prevalent coinfection in patients living with renal failure undergoing to RRT.
A multicenter cross-sectional recruitment across 21 units at the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) at the State of Mexico was performed during 2019. A standardized clinical questionnaire was performed to elucidate individual and relatives-related conditions. A treatment facility questionnaire was applied to the chief responsible of each unit to explore treatment facility variables. Serological testing, clinical, biochemical, and anthropometrical parameters were extracted from clinical records.
In 1,304 patients (57.5% male, mean age 45.5 (SD: 15.6) years, and 95.8% in hemodialysis), the prevalence of any viral coinfection was 3.14% (95% CI: 2.32%-4.23%). The highest viral coinfection prevalence were for HCV, HBV, and HIV, in which men and subjects diagnosed after 2010's had the highest rates.

10462999",Interferon-gamma release assays for diagnosis of latent TB infection in chronic kidney diseases and dialysis patients.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), especially end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), are at risk of developing tuberculosis (TB). The prevalence and predictors of LTBI assessed by a high-sensitivity, high-specificity test such as an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) has not been thoroughly explored.
All patients with CKD were prospectively recruited from September 2020 to November 2021 and retrospectively reviewed from December 2020 to November 2021. The prevalence of LTBI was determined using IGRA by CKD stage and dialysis type. Predictors of LTBI were assessed by logistic regression analysis.
In total, 199 patients with CKD were enrolled (102 prospectively, 97 retrospectively). Of these, 173 patients were evaluable (mean age, 53 ± 16 years; 44% male). Ninety-five (55%) patients had ESKD and were maintained on renal replacement therapy. Overall, 39 (22.5%) patients had LTBI with a prevalence of 25.0%, 12.5%, 25.0%, 25.0%, and 24.2% among patients with CKD stage 1, 2, 3a, 3b, and ESKD, respectively (
In TB-endemic settings, 20% of patients with CKD and 25% of patients with ESKD may have LTBI.

34374224",The prognostic value of speckle tracking echocardiography in patients with end stage renal disease on dialysis.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular death especially as the disease progresses and patients are on long-term dialysis treatment. Left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and cardiac deformation measured by speckle tracking echocardiography seem to play an important prognostic role in several different specific populations.
Τhe prognostic value of strain analysis measurements, including the novel diastolic parameters such as left atrial (LA) strain, in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis (stage 5 CKD).
67 patients (mean age 62.3 ± 11.8, 65.7% men) with stage 5 CKD (45 on hemodialysis and 22 on peritoneal dialysis) were enrolled in the study protocol. The mean duration of dialysis was 102.48 ± 84.98 months. Mean follow-up lasted seven years.
Most of the study population had normal or mildly impaired systolic function with a mean LV ejection fraction of 49.17% (± 10.41) while 70% of patients had impaired LV global longitudinal strain, mean 14.35% (± 4.49). Regarding LA strain parameters the mean LA reservoir, LA conduit, and LA contractile reserve were 24.11% (± 12.61), 10.56% (± 5.88), and 13.60% (± 9.15) respectively. Thus 50% of the population had impaired LA strain. Logistic regression analysis showed that of the various echocardiographic parameters LV ejection fraction, LV global longitudinal strain, and the conduit phase of LA strain were significantly associated with total prognosis (p = 0.009, p = 0.007, p = 0.05). The conduit element of LA strain was the strongest predictor among them, when adjusted for age (OR = 0.77 p = 0.04).
Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction is an important prognostic factor in patients with advanced CKD on long-term dialysis, without known CAD. The novel echocardiographic parameters such as LA strain could add valuable information to the overall cardiac evaluation of this specific population.","['Atrial strain', 'Diastolic dysfunction', 'End-stage renal disease', 'Speckle tracking echocardiography']",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,2022-11-30,"[{'lastname': 'Kakiouzi', 'firstname': 'Vicky', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': ""First Department of Cardiology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Medical School, University of Athens, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 11527, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Tsartsalis', 'firstname': 'Dimitrios', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""First Department of Cardiology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Medical School, University of Athens, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 11527, Athens, Greece. dtsartsalis@hippocratio.gr.\nDepartment of Emergency Medicine, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Athens, Greece. dtsartsalis@hippocratio.gr.""}, {'lastname': 'Aggeli', 'firstname': 'Constantina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""First Department of Cardiology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Medical School, University of Athens, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 11527, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Dimitroglou', 'firstname': 'Yannis', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""First Department of Cardiology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Medical School, University of Athens, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 11527, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Latsios', 'firstname': 'Georgios', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""First Department of Cardiology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Medical School, University of Athens, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 11527, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Tsiamis', 'firstname': 'Eleftherios', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""First Department of Cardiology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Medical School, University of Athens, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 11527, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Giannou', 'firstname': 'Panagiota', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Karampela', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Petras', 'firstname': 'Dimitrios', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Vlachopoulos', 'firstname': 'Charalambos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""First Department of Cardiology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Medical School, University of Athens, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 11527, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Tousoulis', 'firstname': 'Dimitrios', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""First Department of Cardiology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Medical School, University of Athens, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 11527, Athens, Greece.""}, {'lastname': 'Tsioufis', 'firstname': 'Costas', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""First Department of Cardiology, 'Hippokration' Hospital, Medical School, University of Athens, Vasilissis Sofias 114, 11527, Athens, Greece.""}]",None,None,"Most of the study population had normal or mildly impaired systolic function with a mean LV ejection fraction of 49.17% (± 10.41) while 70% of patients had impaired LV global longitudinal strain, mean 14.35% (± 4.49).

94,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36423334,Humoral response after the fourth dose of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in the CKD spectrum: a prespecified analysis of the SENCOVAC study.,"There is scarce evidence on the fourth dose of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 vaccines in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We evaluated the humoral response and effectivity of the fourth dose in the CKD spectrum: non-dialysis CKD (ND-CKD), haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and kidney transplant (KT) recipients.
This is a prespecified analysis of the prospective, observational, multicentric SENCOVAC study. In patients with CKD who had received a complete initial vaccination and one or two boosters and had anti-Spike antibody determinations 6 and 12 months after the initial vaccination, we analysed factors associated with persistent negative humoral response and higher anti-Spike antibody titres as well as the efficacy of vaccination on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity.
Of 2186 patients (18% KT, 8% PD, 69% HD and 5% ND-CKD), 30% had received a fourth dose. The fourth dose increased anti-Spike antibody titres in HD (P = .001) and ND-CKD (P = .014) patients and seroconverted 72% of previously negative patients. Higher anti-Spike antibody titres at 12 months were independently associated with repeated exposure to antigen (fourth dose, previous breakthrough infections), previous anti-Spike antibody titres and not being a KT recipient. Breakthrough COVID-19 was registered in 137 (6%) patients, 5% of whom required admission. Admitted patients had prior titres <620 UI/ml and median values were lower (P = .020) than in non-admitted patients.

21914037",Menstrual Abnormalities and Reproductive Lifespan in Females with CKD: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Menstrual abnormalities and shortened reproductive lifespan are associated with shorter life expectancy and higher cardiovascular and osteoporosis risk in the general population, although the magnitude of these reproductive factor irregularities in females with CKD is unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the current knowledge regarding menstrual abnormalities and reproductive lifespan among females with CKD.
A comprehensive bibliographic search (MEDLINE, Embase, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature [CINAHL]) was completed from database inception to February 2022 to identify all original articles reporting on females of reproductive age with nondialysis-dependent/nonkidney transplant CKD, dialysis-dependent CKD, or kidney transplantation and menstruation patterns, age of menarche, and/or menopause. Data extraction and study quality assessment were completed in duplicate. Random effects meta-analyses were used to derive pooled proportions estimates.
Forty-six studies were identified, and 35 were meta-analyzed, stratified by KRT modality and reported outcome. Menstrual abnormalities were present in 19%-47% of patients on hemodialysis and 75% of patients on peritoneal dialysis. Kidney transplantation was associated with a 7%-30% decrease in menstrual abnormalities. Reproductive lifespan was 32 years (95% confidence interval, 30 to 34 years). Although significant heterogeneity was present, study quality ranged from fair to good, and no evidence of publication bias was noted.
Menstrual abnormalities and shorter reproductive lifespan are common in females with CKD, although kidney transplantation may improve menstrual health.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'end stage kidney disease', 'kidney transplantation', 'menarche', 'menopause', 'menstrual disturbances', 'menstrual irregularities', 'menstruation', 'reproductive life span']",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2022-11-24,"[{'lastname': 'Rytz', 'firstname': 'Chantal L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Libin Cardiovascular Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nCumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Kochaksaraei', 'firstname': 'Golasa Samedi', 'initials': 'GS', 'affiliation': 'Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Skeith', 'firstname': 'Leslie', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nO'Brien Institute of Public Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nAlberta Kidney Disease Network, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Ronksley', 'firstname': 'Paul E', 'initials': 'PE', 'affiliation': ""Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nDepartment of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nO'Brien Institute of Public Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nAlberta Kidney Disease Network, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Dumanski', 'firstname': 'Sandra M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': ""Libin Cardiovascular Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nCumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nO'Brien Institute of Public Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nAlberta Kidney Disease Network, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Robert', 'firstname': 'Magali', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahmed', 'firstname': 'Sofia B', 'initials': 'SB', 'affiliation': ""Libin Cardiovascular Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nCumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nO'Brien Institute of Public Health, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nAlberta Kidney Disease Network, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.""}]",None,None,"Forty-six studies were identified, and 35 were meta-analyzed, stratified by KRT modality and reported outcome.

33270187","The ABCs of personalized incremental dialysis start, Le Mans style.","Thrice weekly hemodialysis (HD) is considered the standard of care for patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) on extracorporeal renal replacement therapy. However, recent evidence has shown that up to one third of patients start dialysis with a residual kidney function that could allow a reduced frequency/dialysis dose. Interest towards HD schedules other than thrice weekly and the lessons learned from peritoneal dialysis, in addition to growing attention to patients' quality of life, have promoted renewed attention towards incremental HD (iHD). iHD comprises once and twice weekly schedules, makes it possible to soften the ""dialysis shock"" at the inception of therapy and is patient-friendly. Moreover, it might contribute to preserving residual kidney function longer. Nevertheless, iHD is performed differently in different settings and no guidelines exist on this subject. Taking advantage of the experience accrued with regard to the treatment of advanced CKD both in the outpatient clinic and in the dialysis unit in Le Mans, where two thirds of incident HD patients start in an incremental way, we aimed to present the practical aspects of iHD and discuss its advantages and drawbacks.","['Incremental hemodialysis', 'Personalized hemodialysis', 'Pre-dialysis care', 'Quality of life']",Journal of nephrology,2022-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Torreggiani', 'firstname': 'Massimo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Néphrologie et Dialyse, Centre Hospitalier Le Mans, 194 Avenue Rubillard, 72037, Le Mans, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Fois', 'firstname': 'Antioco', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Néphrologie et Dialyse, Centre Hospitalier Le Mans, 194 Avenue Rubillard, 72037, Le Mans, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Samoreau', 'firstname': 'Clement', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Néphrologie et Dialyse, Centre Hospitalier Le Mans, 194 Avenue Rubillard, 72037, Le Mans, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Santagati', 'firstname': 'Giulia', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Néphrologie et Dialyse, Centre Hospitalier Le Mans, 194 Avenue Rubillard, 72037, Le Mans, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Piccoli', 'firstname': 'Giorgina Barbara', 'initials': 'GB', 'affiliation': 'Néphrologie et Dialyse, Centre Hospitalier Le Mans, 194 Avenue Rubillard, 72037, Le Mans, France. gbpiccoli@yahoo.it.'}]",None,None,None,© 2022.

33091904",Case report and review of the literature: Successful transition from acute continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration therapy to chronic peritoneal dialysis in a chronically ventilated child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome following fontan.,"Fontan palliation depends on low pulmonary vascular resistance in order to maintain pulmonary blood flow and adequate oxygenation. This physiology results in higher central venous pressures with limited renal perfusion pressure and cardiac output. Positive pressure ventilation with mechanical ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure and raises central venous pressure and can further limit pulmonary and renal perfusion. Fluid removal with intermittent hemodialysis can be challenging in Fontan patients and can cause intolerable hypotension, however the increased abdominal filling pressures during peritoneal dialysis dwells can exacerbate systemic venous hypertension seen in Fontan patients and threaten adequate pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output. Successful transition to peritoneal dialysis in a chronically ventilated patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, end-stage renal disease and Fontan physiology has not been described. We present details outlining the successful transition across multiple modalities of renal replacement therapy to assist other teams faced with similar challenges in chronically ventilated Fontan patients with end-stage renal disease.","['acute kidney injury', 'chronic kidney disease', 'fontan', 'hemodialysis', 'hypoplastic left heart syndrome', 'peritoneal dialiysis', 'renal replacement therapy']",Frontiers in pediatrics,2022-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Susan D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Lande', 'firstname': 'Marc B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuebler', 'firstname': 'Joseph D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Cholette', 'firstname': 'Jill M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, United States.'}]",None,None,None,"© 2022 Martin, Lande, Kuebler and Cholette.","10.3389/fped.2022.1040869

902843",Effectiveness of Dialysis in Psoriasis: A Short Review.,"Psoriasis is a chronic, incurable condition with an erratic course of symptoms and triggers by nature. Psoriasis patients need medical attention that extends beyond only treating skin conditions and joint issues. Because psoriasis is so complex, treating it with medication alone does not work well; comprehensive, whole-person treatment is required. Screening for concomitant diseases including hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular issues, and their adverse effects like myocardial infarction and stroke is a part of treating psoriasis. Regular screening for these linked illnesses should be done. Essential elements of psoriasis care include co-medication to avoid drug interactions or drug-induced psoriasis, as well as the identification and management of trigger factors. The lack of widely used and established diagnostic criteria restricts these studies. Essential elements of psoriasis management include routine screening for these associated disorders, co-medication to avoid drug interactions or psoriasis caused by drugs, as well as the identification of trigger factors and their management. This short review highlights the effectiveness of dialysis in people with psoriasis and the fact that the benefit is more pronounced with peritoneal dialysis than with hemodialysis.","['chronic kidney disease\xa0(ckd)', 'dialysis', 'end stage kidney disease (eskd)', 'haemodialysis', 'impacts', 'kidney function', 'non-uremic patients', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'psoriasis', 'renal failure']",Cureus,2022-11-17,"[{'lastname': 'Pandey', 'firstname': 'Pooja', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, IND.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Sunil', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, IND.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2022, Pandey et al.",10.7759/cureus.30061,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17e736fc0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,36381899,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36381899,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

10523013",Testosterone Deficiency and Nutritional Parameters as Predictors of All-Cause Mortality among Male Dialysis Patients.,"Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an accelerated risk of cardiovascular mortality. Hormonal and metabolic disorders in CKD may constitute novel risk factors. Our objective was to characterize and evaluate prognostic implications of circulating sex steroids and selected nutritional parameters in patients at different stages of CKD. Methods: Studied groups were composed of 78 men: 31 on hemodialysis (HD), 17 on peritoneal dialysis (PD), 30 with CKD stage G3-G4. Total testosterone (TT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S), androstenedione, luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), and biochemical parameters were measured; Free testosterone (FT) was calculated. Results: The lowest TT and FT were observed in HD, the highest- in CKD (p = 0.006 for TT, p = 0.005 for FT). TT positively correlated with total cholesterol in HD (p = 0.012), FT negatively correlated with BMI in CKD (p = 0.023). During the 12 months, 9 patients died (5 in the HD, 4 in the PD group). The deceased group had significantly lower concentrations of albumin (p = 0.006) and prealbumin (p = 0.001), and a significantly higher concentration of androstenedione (p = 0.019) than the surviving group. In the group of men on dialysis, a serum TT concentration <2.55 ng/mL (Q1-first quartile) was associated with a 3.7-fold higher risk of death, although statistical significance was not achieved (p = 0.198). After analysis of the ROC curves, the FT level was the best prognostic marker in HD (AUC = 0.788; 95% CI: 0.581−0.996; p = 0.006) Conclusions: Total and free testosterone levels were lower in the HD group than in the CKD group. The nutritional status undoubtedly affects the survival of dialysis patients but also the concentrations of testosterone significantly contributes to further worsening the prognosis.","['chronic kidney disease', 'hormonal disorders', 'protein-energy wasting (PEW)', 'testosterone']",Nutrients,2022-11-12,"[{'lastname': 'Leśniak', 'firstname': 'Ksymena', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Diseases, Nephrology and Dialysis, Military Institute of Medicine, 04-141 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Rymarz', 'firstname': 'Aleksandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Diseases, Nephrology and Dialysis, Military Institute of Medicine, 04-141 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sobol', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biophysics, Physiology and Pathophysiology, Medical University of Warsaw, 02-004 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Dymus', 'firstname': 'Jolanta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Diagnostics, Military Institute of Medicine, 04-141 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Woźniak-Kosek', 'firstname': 'Agnieszka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Diagnostics, Military Institute of Medicine, 04-141 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Niemczyk', 'firstname': 'Stanisław', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Diseases, Nephrology and Dialysis, Military Institute of Medicine, 04-141 Warsaw, Poland.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/nu14214461

23809289","Dialysis Decision Making, Dialysis Experiences, and Illness Perceptions: A Qualitative Study of Pakistani Patients Receiving Maintenance Hemodialysis.","The incidence and prevalence of patients with kidney failure requiring dialysis are increasing in Pakistan. However, in-depth perspectives on kidney care from Pakistani people requiring maintenance dialysis are lacking.
Qualitative interview study.
Between September 2020 and January 2021, we interviewed 20 adults receiving maintenance hemodialysis in 2 outpatient dialysis units in Pakistan. We asked open-ended questions to explore their experiences with various aspects of kidney care.
We recorded, transcribed, and then, using a phenomenological approach, thematically analyzed interviews.
We observed the following 6 main themes: (1) Patients perceived various supernatural phenomena as causes of their illness and chose traditional medicine for chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment. (2) Patients expressed dissatisfaction with their physicians' communication. They felt poorly informed and resented their decision to initiate dialysis. (3) Family members tried to dissuade patients away from dialysis but also provided support once dialysis was initiated. (4) Patients and families found it challenging to afford dialysis and transplantation and also to arrange for transportation. (5) Women found it challenging to fulfill their obligations as wives and mothers while receiving maintenance dialysis. (6) Patients seemed reluctant to discuss end-of-life care.
We collected data from only 2 hospitals in neighboring cities. Additionally, patients on peritoneal dialysis were not included.
Our findings shed light on patients' perspectives on kidney care in Pakistan and call for financially feasible solutions to raise kidney disease awareness and improve patients' experiences with dialysis. Physician training in communication and shared dialysis decision making along with the development of culturally adapted decision aids are needed to improve CKD knowledge and shared decision making. Although financial challenges preclude many from receiving long-term dialysis, cost-effective strategies to improve the availability of other options (eg, supportive kidney care, peritoneal dialysis, and transplantation) are still warranted.","['Challenges of Pakistani dialysis patients', 'developing countries', 'dialysis decision making', 'end-of-life care', 'financial challenges', 'kidney care', 'patient perspectives', 'qualitative research']",Kidney medicine,2022-11-11,"[{'lastname': 'Malik', 'firstname': 'Sheza', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Army Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Allen', 'firstname': 'Rebecca J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Mount St Joseph University, School of Behavioral and Natural Sciences, Cincinnati, OH.'}, {'lastname': 'Vachharajani', 'firstname': 'Tushar J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, Department of Kidney Medicine, Glickman Urological & Kidney Institute, Cleveland, OH.'}, {'lastname': 'Kluger', 'firstname': 'Benzi', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Department of Medicine, Division of Neurology, Rochester, NY.\nUniversity of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Department of Medicine, Division of Palliative Care, Rochester, NY.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahmad', 'firstname': 'Ijaz', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Saeed', 'firstname': 'Fahad', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Department of Medicine, Division of Palliative Care, Rochester, NY.\nUniversity of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Rochester, NY.'}]",None,None,We observed the following 6 main themes: (1) Patients perceived various supernatural phenomena as causes of their illness and chose traditional medicine for chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment.

32800843","The hidden financial catastrophe of chronic kidney disease under universal coverage and Thai ""Peritoneal Dialysis First Policy"".","Universal health coverage can decrease the magnitude of the individual patient's financial burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the residual financial hardship from the patients' perspective has not been well-studied in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aimed to evaluate the residual financial burden in patients with CKD stage 3 to dialysis in the ""PD First Policy"" under Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) in Thailand.
This multicenter nationwide cross-sectional study in Thailand enrolled 1,224 patients with pre-dialysis CKD, hemodialysis (HD), and peritoneal dialysis (PD) covered by UCS and other health schemes for employees and civil servants. We interviewed patients to estimate the proportion with catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and medical impoverishment. The risk factors associated with CHE were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression.
Under UCS, the total out-of-pocket expenditure in HD was over two times higher than PD and nearly six times higher than CKD stages 3-4. HD suffered significantly more CHE and medical impoverishment than PD and pre-dialysis CKD [CHE: 8.5, 9.3, 19.5, 50.0% (
Despite universal coverage, the residual financial burden remained high in patients with kidney failure. CHE was considerably lower in PD than HD, although the rates remained alarmingly high in the poor. The ""PD First' program"" could serve as a model for other LMICs. However, strategies to minimize financial distress should be further developed, especially for the poor.","['Asia', 'catastrophic health expenditure', 'economic', 'impoverishment', 'kidney failure', 'universal health insurance']",Frontiers in public health,2022-11-01,"[{'lastname': 'Sangthawan', 'firstname': 'Pornpen', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Klyprayong', 'firstname': 'Pinkaew', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Geater', 'firstname': 'Sarayut L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Tanvejsilp', 'firstname': 'Pimwara', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy Administration, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Anutrakulchai', 'firstname': 'Sirirat', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Boongird', 'firstname': 'Sarinya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Gojaseni', 'firstname': 'Pongsathorn', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Bhumibol Adulyadej Hospital, Directorate of Medical Services, Royal Thai Air Force, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuhiran', 'firstname': 'Charan', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Somdej Pranangchao Sirikit Hospital, Chonburi, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Lorvinitnun', 'firstname': 'Pichet', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Noppakun', 'firstname': 'Kajohnsak', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Parapiboon', 'firstname': 'Watanyu', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Maharat Nakhonratchasima Hospital, Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Sirilak', 'firstname': 'Supinda', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Naresuan University Hospital, Naresuan University, Phitsanulok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Tankee', 'firstname': 'Pluemjit', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Vachiraphuket Hospital, Phuket, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Taruangsri', 'firstname': 'Puntapong', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Nakornping Hospital, Chiang Mai, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Sangsupawanich', 'firstname': 'Pasuree', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Songkhla, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Sritara', 'firstname': 'Piyamitr', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chaiyakunapruk', 'firstname': 'Nathorn', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacotherapy, College of Pharmacy, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.\nIDEAS Center, Veterans Affairs Salt Lake City Healthcare System, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kitiyakara', 'firstname': 'Chagriya', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}]",None,None,"Under UCS, the total out-of-pocket expenditure in HD was over two times higher than PD and nearly six times higher than CKD stages 3-4.

23815495",Role of skin autofluorescence in managing renal and cardiac diseases in outpatient dermatology.,"The accumulation of tissue-advanced glycation end products in skin results from complex and consecutive reactions and can be measured by skin autofluorescence (SAF) reader devices. This overview discusses studies evaluating the utilization of SAF in screening renal and cardiac disease.
Literature search was performed using Google Scholar, PubMed, Springer, Ovid, and ScienceDirect.
SAF was an independent predictor of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and was elevated in subjects on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Furthermore, SAF was significantly associated with cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in CKD patients. Other studies revealed a correlation between SAF and arterial stiffness, vascular damage, and subclinical atherosclerosis. A vegetarian diet was associated with lower SAF levels, whereas malnutrition was correlated with higher levels and increased mortality.
SAF measurement may be useful in managing renal and cardiac disease. Future studies are needed to clarify the specific role of SAF in the management of CKD and its noninvasive office utilization to identify comorbidities in inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis.","['advanced glycation end products (AGE)', 'end-stage renal disease', 'kidney disease', 'kidney failure', 'skin autofluorescence (SAF)']",Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging (ISSI),2022-10-29,"[{'lastname': 'Etaee', 'firstname': 'Farshid', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Naguib', 'firstname': 'Tarek', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, Texas, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Goldust', 'firstname': 'Mohamad', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Yale University, New Haven, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Daveluy', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Maibach', 'firstname': 'Howard', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.'}]",None,None,"SAF was an independent predictor of progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and was elevated in subjects on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.

36011725",Long-Term Dynamic Humoral Response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA Vaccines in Patients on Peritoneal Dialysis.,"Introduction. Patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) present an impaired humoral response against SARS-CoV-2, at least after the initial vaccination and booster dose. Until now, the effect of a fourth dose has not been established. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the long-term dynamics of the humoral response of PD patients to multiple doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, focusing on the effect of the fourth dose. Methods. This is an analysis of the prospective and multicentric SENCOVAC study. We included patients on PD without additional immunosuppression that had received at least 3 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine doses. We evaluated anti-spike antibody titers after the initial vaccination, third and fourth doses, using prespecified fixed assessments (i.e., baseline, 28 days, 3, 6, and 12 months after completing the initial vaccine schedule). Breakthrough infections were also collected. Results. We included 164 patients on PD (69% males, 62 ± 13 years old). In patients who had received only two doses, the rates of positive humoral response progressively decreased from 96% at 28 days to 80% at 6 months, as did with anti-spike antibody titers. At 6 months, 102 (62%) patients had received the third vaccine dose. Patients with the third dose had higher rates of positive humoral response (p = 0.01) and higher anti-spike antibody titers (p < 0.001) at 6 months than those with only 2 doses. At 12 months, the whole cohort had received 3 vaccine doses, and 44 (27%) patients had an additional fourth dose. The fourth dose was not associated to higher rates of positive humoral response (100 vs. 97%, p = 0.466) or to statistically significant differences in anti-spike antibody titers as compared to three doses (p = 0.371) at 12 months. Prior antibody titers were the only predictor for subsequent higher anti-spike antibody titer (B 0.53 [95%CI 0.27−0.78], p < 0.001). The 2 (1.2%) patients that developed COVID-19 during follow-up had mild disease. Conclusions. PD presents an acceptable humoral response with three doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that improve the progressive loss of anti-spike antibody titers following two vaccine doses.","['COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'anti-spike antibodies', 'booster', 'chronic kidney disease', 'humoral response', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Vaccines,2022-10-28,"[{'lastname': 'Quiroga', 'firstname': 'Borja', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, 28006 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Soler', 'firstname': 'María José', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': ""Nephrology Department, Vall d'Hebrón University Hospital, 08035 Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Ortiz', 'firstname': 'Alberto', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'IIS-Fundación Jimenez Diaz, School of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Fundación Renal Iñigo Alvarez de Toledo-IRSIN, REDinREN, Instituto de Investigación Carlos III, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gansevoort', 'firstname': 'Ron T', 'initials': 'RT', 'affiliation': 'Dept.

29079835",Evolving Concepts on Inflammatory Biomarkers and Malnutrition in Chronic Kidney Disease.,"While patient care, kidney replacement therapy, and transplantation techniques for chronic kidney disease (CKD) have continued to progress, the incidence of malnutrition disorders in CKD appears to have remained unchanged over time. However, there is now a better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology according to the disease background, disease stage, and the treatment received. In CKD patients, the increased production of proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress lead to a proinflammatory milieu that is at least partially responsible for the increased morbidity and mortality in this patient population. New insights into the pathogenic role of innate immunity and the proinflammatory cytokine profile, characterized, for instance, by higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, explain some of the clinical and laboratory abnormalities observed in these patients. In this article, we will explore currently available nutritional-inflammatory biomarkers in distinct CKD populations (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, transplantation) with a view to evaluating their efficacy as predictors of malnutrition and their involvement in the common proinflammatory process. Although there is a direct relationship between inflammatory-nutritional status, signs and symptoms [e.g., protein-energy wasting (PEW), anorexia], and comorbidities (e.g., atheromatosis, atherosclerosis), we are in need of clearly standardized markers for nutritional-inflammatory assessment to improve their performance and design appropriate bidirectional interventions.","['CKD', 'MICS', 'MIS', 'chronic kidney disease', 'cytokines', 'inflammation', 'malnutrition', 'malnutrition inflammation cachexia syndrome', 'malnutrition-inflammation score', 'proinflammatory cytokines', 'protein-energy wasting', 'sarcopenia']",Nutrients,2022-10-28,"[{'lastname': 'Graterol Torres', 'firstname': 'Fredzzia', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.\nMedicine Department, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Molina', 'firstname': 'María', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.\nMedicine Department, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Soler-Majoral', 'firstname': 'Jordi', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Romero-González', 'firstname': 'Gregorio', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.\nInternational Renal Research Institute of Vicenza, 36100 Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodríguez Chitiva', 'firstname': 'Néstor', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Troya-Saborido', 'firstname': 'Maribel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.\nMedicine Department, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Socias Rullan', 'firstname': 'Guillem', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Endocrinology and Nutrition Department, Hospital Universitari Germans Trias i Pujol, 08916 Badalona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Burgos', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Paúl Martínez', 'firstname': 'Javier', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Urrutia Jou', 'firstname': 'Marina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cañameras', 'firstname': 'Carles', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Riera Sadurní', 'firstname': 'Josep', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Vila', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Bover', 'firstname': 'Jordi', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (HGTiP) & REMAR-IGTP Group, Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute (IGTP), Can Ruti Campus, 08916 Badalona, Spain.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/nu14204297

19308899",The relationship between platelet distribution width and new-onset cardiovascular disease events in patients with peritoneal dialysis.,"The global mortality rate from chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased over the past two decades. Typically, peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains a useful alternative treatment for end-stage renal disease. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main complication in PD patients. In terms of prognosis, it is reported that platelet distribution width (PDW) can predict adverse CVD events. However, the relationship between PDW and new-onset CVD in PD patients is not clear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between PDW and new-onset CVD in PD patients.
This was a retrospective cohort study, from 4 July 2005 to 31 December 2019, and a total of 1557 patients were recruited. PDW was respectively categorized into two groups: PDW ≤13.2 fL and PDW >13.2 fL. The primary outcome was a new-onset CVD event. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to assess the hazard ratio (HR). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the PDW on CVD events.
During follow-up, 114 new-onset CVD events were recorded. Cox proportional hazards models showed a higher risk of CVD events in patients with high PDW (HR = 1.862 95%CI 1.205-2.877,

33197395",Unmet needs about iron deficiency in peritoneal dialysis: a Delphi consensus panel.,"Anaemia and iron deficiency (ID) are common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and related to outcomes. There is growing interest about the role of iron supplementation in CKD, particularly ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), also in relation to the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). Despite a greater knowledge on ID management in patients receiving haemodialysis, a paucity of data exists about peritoneal dialysis (PD). Furthermore, the aim of this paper is to provide the results of a nationwide Italian survey about ID in PD using the Delphi method.
A list of 16 statements (48 items) was developed about four main topics: (1) approach to iron therapy in PD; (2) management experience about iron therapy in PD; (3) ESA and iron in PD; (4) pharmacoeconomic impact. Using the Delphi methodology, the survey was distributed online to 36 Italian nephrologists with expertise in PD, who rated their level of agreement with each item on a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was predefined as more than 66% of the panel agreeing/disagreeing with any given statement.
Twenty-five experts (70%) answered the survey. 35 items (73%) achieved a consensus (8 negative and 27 positive). In particular, the diagnosis of ID is widely known, but some doubts exist about how frequently test it. The use of I.V. iron seems to be routinary and can save money reducing the administration of ESAs. However, internal protocols are welcome.
Expert PD nephrologists know well the problem of ID and feel the necessity of shared protocols to optimize the iron therapy and consequently the use of ESAs.","['Anaemia', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Ferric carboxymaltose', 'Iron deficiency', 'Peritoneal dialysis']",BMC nephrology,2022-10-22,"[{'lastname': 'Mazzaferro', 'firstname': 'Sandro', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Nephrologic and Geriatric Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': ""D'Alonzo"", 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Nephrology Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario ""A.

108,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36266230,Transitions in an integrated model of renal replacement therapy in a regional health system.,"The choice of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is an important decision that determines the quality of life and survival. Most patients change from one RRT modality to another to adapt RRT to clinical and psychosocial needs. This has been called «integrated model of RRT» that implies new questions about the best sequence of techniques.
The study describes the impact of transitions between RRT modalities on survival using the Madrid Registry of Renal Patients (2008-2018). This study used the proportional hazards models and competitive risk models to perform an intention-to-treat (ITT), according to their 1st RRT modality and as-treated (AT) analysis, that consider also their 1st transition.
A total of 8971 patients started RRT during this period in Madrid (6.6 Million population): 7207 (80.3%) on hemodialysis (HD), 1401 (15.6%) on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 363 (4.2%) received a pre-emptive kidney transplantation (KT). Incident HD-patients were older (HD group 65.3 years (SD 15.3) vs PD group 58.1 years (SD 14.8) vs KTX group 52 years (SD 17.2); p < 0.001) and had more comorbidities. They presented higher mortality (HD group 40.9% vs PD group 22.8% vs KTX group 8.3%, p < 0.001) and less access to a transplant (HD group 30.4% vs PD group 51.6%; p < 0.001). Transitions between dialysis techniques define different groups of patients with different clinical outcomes. Those who change from HD to PD do it earlier (HD → PD: 0.7 years (SD 1.1) vs PD → HD: 1.5 years (SD 1.4) p < 0.001), are younger (HD → PD: 53.5 years (SD 16.7) vs PD → HD: 61.6 years (SD 14.6); p < 0.001), presented less mortality (HD → PD: 24.5% vs PD → HD: 32.0%; p < 0.001) and higher access to a transplant (HD → PD: 49.4% vs PD → HD: 31.7%; p < 0.001). Survival analysis by competitive risks is essential for integrated RRT models, especially in groups such as PD patients, where 51.6% of the patients were considered as lost follow-up (received a KTX after during the first 2.5 years on PD). In this analysis, survival of patients who change from one technique to another, is more similar to the destination modality than the origin one.
Our data suggest that transitions between RRT-techniques describes different patients, who associate different risks, and could be analyzed in an integrated manner to define improvement actions. This approach should be incorporated into the analysis and reports of renal registries.","['Advanced chronic kidney disease', 'Enfermedad renal crónica avanzada', 'Integrated model', 'Modelo integrado', 'Mortalidad', 'Mortality', 'Renal replacement therapy', 'Transiciones', 'Transition', 'Tratamiento renal sustitutivo']",Nefrologia,2022-10-21,"[{'lastname': 'Gil-Casares', 'firstname': 'Beatriz', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Servicio de Nefrología, Hospital del Sureste, Arganda del Rey, Madrid, Spain; Departamento de Teoría de la Señal y Comunicaciones y Sistemas Telemáticos y de Computación, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Fuenlabrada, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Portolés', 'firstname': 'Jose', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Servicio de Nefrología, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain; REDInREN RETIC ISCIII 16/009/009.

Children with chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease are at risk for development of hyperlipidemia. In this report, we describe a 7-month-old male infant with Denys-Drash syndrome who was found to have a ""milky-layer"" floating on the deaerator of the hemodialysis machine. Investigations showed severe hypertriglyceridemia of >1000 mg/dl. The patient had been on chronic continuous manual peritoneal dialysis until 6 months of age and recently had been switched to hemodialysis. Management included lowering of caloric intake and addition of medium chain triglyceride with reduction of the serum triglyceride levels to 300-400 mg/dl. Close monitoring of serum lipids and timely intervention is important to prevent serious complications associated with dyslipidemia. Observation of the ""milky layer"" in the deaerator of the hemodialysis machine may be an interesting visual clue of underlying severe hypertriglyceridemia.","['hemodialysis', 'hypertriglyceridemia', 'infant']",Hemodialysis international.

32872003","Research features between Urology and Nephrology authors in articles regarding UTI related to CKD, HD, PD, and renal transplantation.","A urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common types of infections affecting the urinary tract. When bacteria enter the bladder or kidney and multiply in the urine, a URI can occur. The urethra is shorter in women than in men, which makes it easier for bacteria to reach the bladder or kidneys and cause infection. A comparison of the research differences between Urology and Nephrology (UN) authors regarding UTI pertaining to the 4 areas (i.e., Chronic Kidney Disease, Hemodialysis, Peritoneal Dialysis, and Renal Transplantation [CHPR]) is thus necessary. We propose and verify 2 hypotheses: CHPR-related articles on UTI have equal journal impact factors (JIFs) in research achievements (RAs) and UN authors have similar research features (RFs).
Based on keywords associated with UTI and CHPR in titles, subject areas, and abstracts since 2013, we obtained 1284 abstracts and their associated metadata (e.g., citations, authors, research institutes, departments, countries of origin) from the Web of Science core collection. There were 1030 corresponding and first (co-first) authors with hT-JIF-indices (i.e., JIF was computed using hT-index rather than citations as usual). The following 5 visualizations were used to present the author's RA: radar, Sankey, time-to-event, impact beam plot, and choropleth map. The forest plot was used to distinguish RFs by observing the proportional counts of keyword plus in Web of Science core collection between UN authors.
It was observed that CHPR-related articles had unequal JIFs (χ2 = 13.08, P = .004, df = 3, n = 1030) and UN departments had different RFs (Q = 53.24, df = 29, P = .004). In terms of countries, institutes, departments, and authors, the United States (hT-JIF = 38.30), Mayo Clinic (12.9), Nephrology (19.14), and Diana Karpman (10.34) from Sweden had the highest hT-JIF index.
With the aid of visualizations, the hT-JIF-index and keyword plus were demonstrated to assess RAs and distinguish RFs between UN authors.

19696626",The role of copeptin in kidney disease.,"Copeptin is a 39-amino acid glycopeptide that is secreted equimolecularly with arginine-vasopressin (AVP) from the prepro-hormone AVP in the posterior pituitary. While AVP is a very unstable molecule and is accompanied by significant technical troubles in its quantification, copeptin is a stable and easily quantifiable molecule. For this reason, circulating copeptin is currently used as a surrogate for AVP in different pathological conditions, including renal diseases. In recent years it has been shown that copeptin is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the general population. In addition, copeptin has also been associated with multiple renal diseases with relevant clinical consequences and potential therapeutic implications. In the present review, we update and summarize the clinical significance of copeptin as a surrogate marker for AVP concentrations in different kidney diseases, as well as in renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) and renal transplantation.","['Antidiuretic hormone', 'Arginine-vasopressin', 'Copeptin', 'Dialysis', 'Kidney disease', 'Renal function']",Endocrine,2022-10-16,"[{'lastname': 'Iglesias', 'firstname': 'Pedro', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain. piglo65@gmail.com.\nInstituto de Investigación Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro Segovia de Arana, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain. piglo65@gmail.com.\nDepartment of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain. piglo65@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Silvestre', 'firstname': 'Ramona A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Physiology, Medical School, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernández-Reyes', 'firstname': 'María José', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital General, Segovia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Díez', 'firstname': 'Juan J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.\nInstituto de Investigación Sanitaria Puerta de Hierro Segovia de Arana, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.'}]",None,None,None,"© 2022.

This study included 2,514 incident dialysis patients from a Korean multicenter prospective cohort. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data to analyze factors associated with the chosen dialysis modality. Differences in these factors were compared between the elderly (≥65 years) and younger (<65 years) patients.
Of the enrolled patients, 1,746 (69.5%) and 768 (30.6%) selected hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD), respectively. The percentage of PD was higher in younger patients than in elderly patients (37.1 vs. 16.9%, 
As the age of patients with chronic kidney disease increased, HD was more frequently selected compared to PD. Dialysis planning and CHF interacted with age in selecting dialysis modalities in elderly patients.

32775832",The Potential Benefits and Controversies of Probiotics Use in Patients at Different Stages of Chronic Kidney Disease.,"The therapeutic modulation of the gut microbiome has been suggested to be one of the tools in the integrated management of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in recent years. Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera are the two most commonly used probiotics strains. Most of the probiotics used in studies are mixed formulation. There is no consensus on the dose and duration of the probiotic administration for CKD patients Increasing evidence indicates that patients with early stage (1-2) CKD have an altered quantitative and qualitative microbiota profile. However, there was a dearth of prospective controlled studies on the use of probiotics in the early stage of the CKD population. The association between gut microbiota disturbance and advanced CKD was reported. Most randomized controlled trials on probiotic treatment used in CKD stage 3-5ND patients reported positive results. The metabolites of abnormal gut microbiota are directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and inflammation. We summarized 13 studies performed in the dialysis population, including 10 in hemodialysis (HD) patients and 3 in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Some controversial results were concluded on the decreasing plasma concentration of uremic toxin, symptoms, inflammation, and cardiovascular risk. Only three randomized controlled trials on PD were reported to show the potential beneficial effects of probiotics on inflammation, uremic toxins and gastrointestinal symptoms. There is still no standard in the dosage and duration of the use of probiotics in CKD patients. Overall, the probiotic administration may have potential benefit in improving symptoms and quality of life, reducing inflammation, and delaying the progression of kidney failure. Further research studies using a larger sample size with longer follow-up durations and a greater focus on clinical outcomes-including survival-are warranted to elucidate the significant clinical impact of the use of probiotics in CKD patients.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'gut dysbiosis', 'probiotics']",Nutrients,2022-10-15,"[{'lastname': 'Tian', 'firstname': 'Na', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Lu', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan 750004, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ng', 'firstname': 'Jack Kit-Chung', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Ngan Shing St., Shatin, Hong Kong, China.\nCarol and Richard Yu Peritoneal Dialysis Research Centre, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Ngan Shing St., Shatin, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Philip Kam-Tao', 'initials': 'PK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Ngan Shing St., Shatin, Hong Kong, China.\nCarol and Richard Yu Peritoneal Dialysis Research Centre, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Ngan Shing St., Shatin, Hong Kong, China.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/nu14194044

25559473",Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Is Associated with a More Favorable Left Ventricular Geometry in Patients with End-Stage Kidney Disease.,"Introduction. The aim of the study was to examine the impact of adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (MD) on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and cardiac geometry in chronic kidney disease patients on dialysis (CKD-5D), given the high prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity in this population. Methods. n = 127 (77 men and 50 women) CKD-5D patients (69 on hemodialysis and 58 on peritoneal dialysis) with a mean age of 62 ± 15 years were studied. An MD adherence score (MDS) (range 0−55, 55 representing maximal adherence) was estimated with a validated method. Echocardiographic LVH was defined by LV mass index (LVMI) > 95 g/m2 in women and >115 g/m2 in men. Based on LVMI and relative wall thickness (RWT), four LV geometric patterns were defined: normal (normal LVMI and RWT), concentric remodeling (normal LVMI and increased RWT > 0.42), eccentric LVH (increased LVMI and normal RWT), and concentric LVH (increased LVMI and RWT). Results. Patients with LVH (n = 81) as compared to patients with no LVH (n = 46) were older in age (66 ± 13 vs. 55 ± 16 years; p < 0.001) had lower MDS (24 ± 2.7 vs. 25 ± 4.3; p < 0.05) and higher malnutrition-inflammation score (5.0 ± 2.7 vs. 3.9 ± 1.9; p < 0.05), body mass index (27.5 ± 4.9 vs. 24.1 ± 3.5 kg/m2; p < 0.001), prevalence of diabetes (79% vs. 20%; p < 0.05), coronary artery disease (78% vs. 20%; p < 0.05) and peripheral vascular disease (78% vs. 20%; p < 0.01). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for all factors mentioned above, each 1-point greater MDS was associated with 18% lower odds of having LVH (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69−0.98; p < 0.05). MDS was inversely related to LVMI (r = −0.273; p = 0.02), and in a multiple linear regression model (where LVMI was analyzed as a continuous variable), MDS emerged as a significant (Β = −2.217; p < 0.01) independent predictor of LVH. Considering LV geometry, there was a progressive decrease in MDS from the normal group (25.0 ± 3.7) to concentric remodeling (25.8 ± 3.0), eccentric (24.0 ± 2.8), and then concentric (23.6 ± 2.7) group (p < 0.05 for the trend). Conclusions. The greater adherence to an MD is associated with lesser LVH, an important cardiovascular disease risk factor; MD preserves normal cardiac geometry and may confer protection against future cardiac dysfunction in dialysis patients.","['Mediterranean diet', 'cardiac geometry', 'end-stage kidney disease', 'left ventricular hypertrophy']",Journal of clinical medicine,2022-10-15,"[{'lastname': 'Bacharaki', 'firstname': 'Dimitra', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Attikon University Hospital, 12462 Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Petrakis', 'firstname': 'Ioannis', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University General Hospital of Heraklion, 71500 Iraklio, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Kyriazis', 'firstname': 'Periklis', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Markaki', 'firstname': 'Anastasia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, Sciences School of Health Science, Hellenic Mediterranean University, 71410 Heraklion, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Pleros', 'firstname': 'Christos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University General Hospital of Heraklion, 71500 Iraklio, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsirpanlis', 'firstname': 'Georgios', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, General Hospital of Genimata, 11527 Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Theodoridis', 'firstname': 'Marios', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Democritus University of Thrace, 68150 Alexandroupolis, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Balafa', 'firstname': 'Olga', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University Hospital of Ioannina, 45500 Ioannina, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Georgoulidou', 'firstname': 'Anastasia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, General Hospital of Komotini, 69133 Komotini, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Drosataki', 'firstname': 'Eleni', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University General Hospital of Heraklion, 71500 Iraklio, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Stylianou', 'firstname': 'Kostas', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, University General Hospital of Heraklion, 71500 Iraklio, Greece.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/jcm11195746

23727169",Chronic Kidney Disease as a Cardiovascular Disorder-Tonometry Data Analyses.,"Tonometry is commonly used to provide efficient and good diagnostics for cardiovascular disease (CVD). There are many advantages of this method, including low cost, non-invasiveness and little time to perform. In this study, the effort was undertaken to check whether tonometry data hides valuable information associated with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) treatment. For this purpose, six groups containing patients at different stages of CKD following different ways of dialysis treatment, as well as patients without CKD but with CVD and healthy volunteers were assessed. It was revealed that each of the studied groups had a unique profile. Only the type of dialysis was indistinguishable a from tonometric perspective (hemodialysis vs. peritoneal dialysis). Several techniques were used to build profiles that independently gave the same outcome: analysis of variance, network correlation structure analysis, multinomial logistic regression, and discrimination analysis. Moreover, to evaluate the classification potential of the discriminatory model, all mentioned techniques were later compared and treated as feature selection methods. Although the results are promising, it could be difficult to express differences as simple mathematical relations. This study shows that artificial intelligence can differentiate between different stages of CKD and patients without CKD. Potential future machine learning models will be able to determine kidney health with high accuracy and thereby classify patients.

117,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36210458,Understanding the practice patterns of nephrology nurse practitioners in Australia.,"Nurse practitioners (NP) have an expanded scope of practice beyond that of a registered nurse. In kidney care, nephrology NP can manage patients at various points along the chronic kidney disease (CKD) trajectory.
To profile the characteristics, service patterns, and domains of practice of nephrology NP in Australia.
A cross-sectional online secure survey.
Nephrology NP (NP students) who were members of the Renal Society of Australasia and working in Australia (n = 73).
Data collected were demographic and practice characteristics, and domains of practice (using the modified Strong Model of Advanced Practice). The survey also sought qualitative perspectives of the enablers and barriers to sustainability nurse practitioner healthcare delivery services.
Nephrology NP (n = 45) primarily worked in adult services, managing those receiving haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or patients with earlier grades of CKD. Providing direct comprehensive care was the dominant domain of advanced practice although administrative activities took up considerable time each week.

This study found a highly qualified, experienced but older nephrology nurse practitioner workforce who provide an additional model of health service delivery which can meet the growing CKD burden. Internationally, this level of nurse provides an opportunity for a career pathway to maintain nurses in direct clinical roles and to expand the nephrology nursing workforce.","['advanced practice nursing', 'nephrology', 'nurse practitioner', 'renal']",Journal of renal care,2022-10-10,"[{'lastname': 'Bonner', 'firstname': 'Ann', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing and Midwifery, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia.\nMenzies Health Institute of Queensland, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia.\nKidney Health Service, Metro North Health, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Douglas', 'firstname': 'Bettina', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing, Midwifery and Social Work, University of Queensland, St Lucia, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Leanne', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Cape York Kidney Care, Torres and Cape Hospital and Health Service, Weipa, St Lucia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Harvie', 'firstname': 'Barbara', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Lucas', 'firstname': 'Anthony', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service, Cairns, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tomlins', 'firstname': 'Melinda', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hunter New England Health District, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gillespie', 'firstname': 'Kerri', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing and Midwifery, Griffith University, Southport, Queensland, Australia.'}]",None,None,"Nephrology NP (n = 45) primarily worked in adult services, managing those receiving haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or patients with earlier grades of CKD.

118,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36210121,Physical exercise and peritoneal dialysis: An area yet to be explored.,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) is profoundly impaired by their frailty, disability and decreased physical capacity. Especially among older patients, a high prevalence of low physical activity levels and reduced functional performance has been reported. Physical exercise training has been shown to have a beneficial impact, counteracting these same hazardous consequences of inactivity and sedentarism both on CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients on hemodialysis (HD) treatment. The evidence-based knowledge on the effects of physical exercise on ESKD patients undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) treatment is scarce, even though this is a continually growing population that shares the same risk factors and desired clinical outcomes as the previously mentioned groups of patients. Further investigation will be necessary to clarify whether this exercise-based approach may be suitable for the PD population. This paper's purpose is to review the available literature, including randomized controlled trials, reviews and meta-analysis results that assessed the impact of physical exercise on patients under PD treatment bearing in mind their HRQoL, physical functioning and cardiovascular parameters. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate the perceived significant barriers and limitations of the PD population in what concerns physical exercise practice and how nephrologists should address them.","['Actividad física', 'Calidad de vida relacionada con la salud', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Diálisis peritoneal', 'Ejercicio físico', 'Enfermedad renal crónica', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Physical activity', 'Physical exercise']",Nefrologia,2022-10-10,"[{'lastname': 'Maia Neves Menezes', 'firstname': 'José Inacio', 'initials': 'JI', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Lopes Pereira', 'firstname': 'Luciano Artur', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Investigation and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, Portugal; INEB - National Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Porto, Portugal; Department of Nephrology, São João Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal.

22607565",Association between serum alkaline phosphatase and bacteraemia in haemodialysis outpatients: a multicentre retrospective cross-sectional study.,"Elevated baseline serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) may correlate with higher medium-term to long-term mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease. However, few data are available on the association between serum ALP and the short-term prognosis of patients on haemodialysis (HD). We verified the association of ALP levels and bacteraemia or death in maintenance HD patients suspected of bacteraemia in an outpatient setting.
We analysed 315 consecutive HD patients suspected of having bacteraemia with two sets of blood culture drawn on admission.
Admission to two tertiary-care university medical centres from January 2013 to December 2015.
Consecutive cases on maintenance HD aged≥18 years. Cases of hospitalised patients who had been transferred from another hospital, had a dialysis vintage<2 months, were also undergoing peritoneal dialysis, and/or were receiving HD less than once a week were excluded.
Primary outcome measure was bacteraemia and secondary outcome was in-hospital death.
Among 315 cases included in the study, 187 had baseline-measured ALP levels, with a cut-off value on ROC analysis of 360 U/L (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.60, sensitivity 0.49, specificity 0.76). In multivariate analysis, there was a statistically significant association between a higher ALP in hospital visit and bacteraemia (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.83). However, there were no statistically significant associations between higher ALP and in-hospital death (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.57 to 2.54). A sensitivity analysis of 187 patients with no missing ALP values also demonstrated a significant association between elevated ALP and bacteraemia, but no significant association between ALP and in-hospital death.
Elevated ALP is a predictor of bacteraemia. In HD patients suspected of bacteraemia in outpatient settings, increased ALP levels were associated with increased likelihood of confirmed disease.","['dialysis', 'infectious diseases', 'nephrology']",BMJ open,2022-10-08,"[{'lastname': 'Katasako', 'firstname': 'Aya', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Iizuka Hospital, Iizuka, Fukuoka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sasaki', 'firstname': 'Sho', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Iizuka Hospital, Iizuka, Fukuoka, Japan sasaki.sho.3f@kyoto-u.ac.jp.\nClinical Research Support Office, Iizuka Hospital, Iizuka, Fukuoka, Japan.\nSection of Education for Clinical Research, Kyoto University Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.\nSection of Clinical Epidemiology, Department of Community Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Raita', 'firstname': 'Yoshihiko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Okinawa Chubu Hospital, Uruma, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamamoto', 'firstname': 'Shungo', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Transformative Infection Control Development Studies, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.\nDivision of Fostering Required Medical Human Resources, Center for Infectious Disease Education and Research(CiDER), Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.\nDivision of Infection Control and Prevention, Osaka University Hospital, Osaka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tochitani', 'firstname': 'Kentaro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Healthcare Epidemiology, Kyoto University Graduate School of Public Health, Kyoto, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Murakami', 'firstname': 'Minoru', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Saku Central Hospital, Saku, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nishioka', 'firstname': 'Ryo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Rheumatology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujisaki', 'firstname': 'Kiichiro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Iizuka Hospital, Iizuka, Fukuoka, Japan.'}]",None,None,"Among 315 cases included in the study, 187 had baseline-measured ALP levels, with a cut-off value on ROC analysis of 360 U/L (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.60, sensitivity 0.49, specificity 0.76).

17894864",Immune response after COVID-19 vaccination among patients with chronic kidney disease and kidney transplant.,"Vaccination of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney transplants (KTs) may achieve a less robust immune response. Understanding such immune responses is crucial for guiding current and future vaccine dosing strategies.
This prospective, observational study estimated the immunogenicity of humoral and cellular responses of two SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in different patient groups with CKD compared with controls. Secondary outcomes included adverse events after vaccination and the incidence of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, including illness severity.
In total, 212 patients received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (89.62 %) or inactivated vaccines (10.38 %).The antibody response against the S protein was analyzed at T0 (before the first injection), T1 (before the second injection), and T2 (12 weeks after the second injection). Seroconversion occurred in 92.31 % of controls at T2 and in 100 % of patients with CKD, 42.86 % undergoing KT, 80.18 % of hemodialysis (HD), and 0 % of patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at T2 of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Neutralizing antibody levels by surrogate virus neutralization test were above the protective level at T2 in each group. The KT group exhibited the lowest neutralizing antibody and T cell response. Blood groups O and vaccine type were associated with good immunological responses. After the first dose, 14 individuals (6.6 out of the total population experienced COVID-19 breakthrough infection.

22521250",Patient Navigators for CKD and Kidney Failure: A Systematic Review.,"To what degree and how patient navigators improve clinical outcomes for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure is uncertain. We performed a systematic review to summarize patient navigator program design, evidence, and implementation in kidney disease.
A search strategy was developed for randomized controlled trials and observational studies that evaluated the impact of navigators on outcomes in the setting of CKD and kidney failure. Articles were identified from various databases. Two reviewers independently screened the articles and identified those meeting the inclusion criteria.
Patients with CKD or kidney failure (in-center hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, home hemodialysis, or kidney transplantation).
Studies that compared patient navigators with a control, without limits on size, duration, setting, or language. Studies focusing solely on patient education were excluded.
Data were abstracted from full texts and risk of bias was assessed.
No meta-analysis was performed.
Of 3,371 citations, 17 articles met the inclusion criteria including 14 original studies. Navigators came from various healthcare backgrounds including nursing (n=6), social worker (n=2), medical interpreter (n=1), research (n=1), and also included kidney transplant recipients (n=2) and non-medical individuals (n=2). Navigators focused mostly on education (n=9) and support (n = 6). Navigators were used for patients with CKD (n=5), peritoneal dialysis (n=2), in-center hemodialysis (n=4), kidney transplantation (n=2), but not home hemodialysis. Navigators improved transplant workup and listing, peritoneal dialysis utilization, and patient knowledge.
Many studies did not show benefits across other outcomes, were at a high risk of bias, and none reported cost-effectiveness or patient-reported experience measures.
Navigators improve some health outcomes for CKD but there was heterogeneity in their structure and function. High-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate navigator program efficacy and cost-effectiveness.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'kidney failure', 'patient navigator', 'systematic review']",Kidney medicine,2022-10-04,"[{'lastname': 'Taha', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Disease Innovation Center, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Iman', 'firstname': 'Yasmin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Disease Innovation Center, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Hingwala', 'firstname': 'Jay', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Disease Innovation Center, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Section of Nephrology, University of Manitoba, Manitoba, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Askin', 'firstname': 'Nicole', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Libraries, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Mysore', 'firstname': 'Priyanka', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Disease Innovation Center, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Section of Nephrology, University of Manitoba, Manitoba, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Rigatto', 'firstname': 'Claudio', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Disease Innovation Center, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Section of Nephrology, University of Manitoba, Manitoba, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bohm', 'firstname': 'Clara', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Disease Innovation Center, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Section of Nephrology, University of Manitoba, Manitoba, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Komenda', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Disease Innovation Center, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Section of Nephrology, University of Manitoba, Manitoba, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tangri', 'firstname': 'Navdeep', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Disease Innovation Center, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Section of Nephrology, University of Manitoba, Manitoba, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Collister', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Disease Innovation Center, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, Section of Nephrology, University of Manitoba, Manitoba, Canada.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}]",None,None,"Of 3,371 citations, 17 articles met the inclusion criteria including 14 original studies.

In this study, we aim to explore the effect of non-protein energy supplement in CKD stage 3b-5 (CKD3b-5) malnourished patients with or without receiving continuous peritoneal dialysis (PD).
30 patients with CKD3b-5 and 20 patients who received PD were identified as malnourished according to Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), and enrolled into this clinical study. Compared with the control group which just received regular nutrition counseling, an additional non-protein energy supplement (600 kcal) was given to the participants for 12 weeks in the intervention group. Before and after study, the nutritional status of patients was judged by human body composition measurement, anthropometric parameters, physical fitness test, and quality of life survey. Other biochemical indexes relating to nutrition, renal function and inflammatory response were also included for disease evaluation.
After 12 weeks of oral non-protein energy supplementation, the body weight, body fat and associated anthropometric parameters significantly increased upon intervention. Also, the participants showed enhanced physical fitness and better life quality in the intervention group. Consistently, the improved nutritional status was further confirmed by biochemical examinations. However, we did not observe a perceptible change of renal function, measured residual renal function, or general inflammatory response indices after intervention.

A prospective multicenter study.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing in patients older than 65 years and is related to morbidity, frailty, and dependence. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has classically been associated with young patients with an active life.
PD should be offered to patients over 65 years. We search for any unfavorable results that may advice not to recommend PD therapy for this group.
To describe PD treatment and outcomes in patients > 65 years, to compare their results with patients < 65 years and to identify areas with room for improvement in a real-life study.
Prospective, observational, and multicenter study performed in incident PD patients, from January 2003 until January 2018.
We included 2,435 PD patients, 31.9% were older than 65 years; there was a difference of 25 years between both groups. Median follow up was 2.1 years. Older than 65 years group had more comorbidity: Diabetes (29.5% vs 17.2%; p < 0.001), previous CV events 34.5% vs 14.0%; p < 0.001), Charlson index (3.8 vs 3.0; p < 0.001). We did not find differences in efficacy and PD adequacy objectives fulfillment, anaemia management or blood pressure during follow-up. Peritonitis rate was higher in older 65 years group (0.65 vs 0.45 episodes/patient/year; p < 0.001), but there was not differences in germs, admission rate and follow up. Mortality was higher in older 65 years group (28.4% vs 9.4%) as expected. PD permanence probability was similar (2.1 years). The main cause of PD withdrawal was transplant in group < 65 years (48.3%) and transfer to HD in group > 65 years. The main reason was caregiver or patient fatigue (20.2%), and not technique failure (7.3%). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed a relation (HR [95%CI]) between mortality and age > 65 years 2.4 [1.9-3.0]; DM 1.6 [1.3-2.1]; CV events 2.1 [1.7-2.7]. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identify a relation between technique failure and age > 65 years 1.5 [1.3-1.9]; DM 1.6 [1.3-1.9] and previous transplant 1.5 [1.2-2.0].
Patients older than 65 years fulfilled PD adequacy criteria during the follow up. We believe PD is a valid option for patients older 65 years. It is necessary to try to prevent infections and patient/caregiver fatigue, to avoid HD transfer for reasons not related to technique failure.","['Diálisis peritoneal', 'Edad avanzada', 'Elderly', 'Fragilidad', 'Fragility', 'Mortalidad', 'Mortality', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Peritonitis']",Nefrologia,2022-09-28,"[{'lastname': 'Portolés', 'firstname': 'Jose', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Servicio de Nefrología, H.

126,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36163236,[Access to the kidney transplantation waiting list for peritoneal dialysis patients in New-Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna].,"Since 2012, a deceased donor kidney transplant program exists for dialysis patients living in New-Caledonia in collaboration with Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia. This program has reduced the time spent out-of-territory for a renal transplantation and has reduced the economic burden of end stage renal disease in New-Caledonia. We have realised a photography of kidney transplants evaluation for patients in peritoneal dialysis in New-Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna. The first aim was to describe access to kidney transplants evaluation for dialysis patients. A second aim was to compare patients with a conformed kidney transplant evaluation and patients without transplant evaluation with no obvious reasons identified.
All patients in peritoneal dialysis in New-Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna at the 2018, 31
In total, 61 patients were included. The average age was 62 years old. The chronic kidney disease care average time was 6.7 years and the dialysis average time was 2.0 years. Among them, 11 (18 %) were registered on the waiting list, 26 (43 %) had at least one kidney transplant medical contraindication, 3 (5 %) had begun transplant exam since less than 6 months and 21 (34 %) had no transplant exam begun or transplant exam begun since more than 6 months without medical contraindication identified. Among those 21 patients, the three most common reasons were a faulty programming transplant exam (67 %; n = 14), a remote living place (48 %; n = 10) and an intercurrent health event (29 %; n = 6). Among patients living in Noumea and suburbs, 74 % had a conformed transplant evaluation against 44 % in patients living outside Noumea and suburbs (P = 0.058). Nearly one in two patients not on the waiting list had have no information about kidney graft or the information was not recorded in the medical record.
This study showed two main factors of a non-conformed transplantation evaluation: living outside Noumea and suburbs and a non-efficient planning of pre-transplant assessment exams. There is also a lack of information to the patient. These risk factors for late registration and non-registration must be considered by the healthcare teams. This study will provide a point of reference to assess the impact of actions to improve access to renal transplantation deployed in New-Caledonia.","['Dialyse', 'Dialysis', 'Futuna', 'Greffe rénale', 'Kidney transplant', 'New-Caledonia', 'Nouvelle-Calédonie', 'Transplantation', 'Wallis']",Nephrologie & therapeutique,2022-09-27,"[{'lastname': 'Baroux', 'firstname': 'Noémie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Résir, Réseau de l'insuffisance rénale de Nouvelle-Calédonie, 98800 Nouméa, Nouvelle-Calédonie; Atir NC, Association pour le traitement et la prévention de l'insuffisance rénale de Nouvelle-Calédonie, 98805 Dumbéa Sur Mer, Nouvelle-Calédonie.

26228783",Multifrequency bioimpedance by spectroscopy vs. routine methods in the management of hydration status in peritoneal dialysis patients: A randomized control trial.,"Overhydration (OH) is common in peritoneal dialysis (PD) and increases the cardiovascular risk. Multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) has been proposed to estimate the hydration in dialysis. Our objective was to evaluate if BIS is superior than control based on clinical assessment plus single-frequency bioimpedance (SF-BIA) on the fluid control and intermediate cardiovascular outcomes.
Randomized controlled study in adult PD patients, with a 9-month follow-up, allocated into two groups: control and BIS. Data were collected from medical records. SF-BIA and BIS, laboratory exams, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography (ECHO), and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were evaluated. The BIS data were available to the medical team only in BIS group.
34 patients completed the study, 17 in each group. At the endpoint the BIS group had a significant (
The results suggest BIS is superior than the clinical evaluation plus SF-BIA for the fluid control of PD patients.

Objectives. to explore the usefulness of the leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) to predict the presence or worsening of dyslipidemia during 1 year of follow-up in children receiving kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Material and methods: a prospective cohort study was performed. Pediatric KRT patients aged between 8 and 17 years who were undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis were included. At enrollment, the lipid profile, adiponectin and leptin levels, and somatometric measurements, including body fat percentage, were determined. At the one-year follow-up, the lipid profile was reassessed. Results: of the 70 patients included, the median age was 13 years, and there was no sex predominance (52.8 % males). At the end of follow-up, the patients were divided into three groups: those without dyslipidemia (WOD), those who developed or experienced worsening of their dyslipidemia (DWD) and those with persistent dyslipidemia (PD). A LAR > 0.85 (OR, 16.7) and body fat percentage (OR, 1.46) were associated with an increased risk of PD and DWD at 12 months, independently of urea level, BMI Z-score, benzafibrate treatment, CKD progression time, and replacement treatment. Conclusions: a LAR > 0.85 and fat body percentage at the beginning of follow-up were strongly associated with the presence, persistence or worsening of dyslipidemia at the 12-month follow-up in children with KRT.

Failure to degenerate results in patent canal between the bladder and the umbilicus called ""patent urachus"" which may lead to serious of symptoms such as umbilical discharge, dermatitis, umbilical infection, abdominal pain or recurrent urinary tract infections. The Tenckhoff catheter is a tube used to perform peritoneal dialysis that is inserted through abdominal wall into peritoneum either by open surgery, minilaparotomy, laparoscopy or needle-guidewire technique.
A 57-years old man was admitted to the hospital after implantation of Tenckhoff catheter by percutaneous technique in order to start peritoneal dialysis treatment. His medical history was: endstage chronic kidney disease (diabetic nephropathy), type 2 diabetes and hypertension. After the infusion of dialysate the patient experienced sudden urine pressure and passed significant amount of urine. The CT scan showed the tip of catheter being placed inside the urinary bladder. The catheter was introduced through the abdominal wall into the canal of previously undiagnosed patent urachus. The decision about re-surgery was made to stitch urachal remnants and place new the Tenckhoff catheter. Awaiting the surgery patient temporary started hemodialysis.

34434952",Nutritional and Hydration Status and Adherence to Dietary Recommendations in Dalmatian Dialysis Patients.,"Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is considered one of the major complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly in dialysis patients. Insufficient energy and protein intake, together with clinical complications, may contribute to the onset and severity of PEW. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyze the differences in nutritional and hydration status and dietary intake among Dalmatian dialysis patients. Fifty-five hemodialysis (HD) and twenty peritoneal dialysis (PD) participants were included. For each study participant, data about body composition, anthropometric, laboratory, and clinical parameters were obtained. The Malnutrition Inflammation Score (MIS) and two separate 24-h dietary recalls were used to assess nutritional status and dietary intake. The Nutrient Adequacy Ratio (NAR) and Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR) were calculated to compare actual dietary intake with recommended intake. Additionally, the estimated 10-year survival was calculated using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. The prevalence of malnutrition according to MIS was 47.3% in HD and 45% in PD participants. Significant differences in fat tissue parameters were found between HD and PD participants, whereas significant differences in hydration status and muscle mass parameters were not found. A significant difference in NAR between HD and PD participants was noticed for potassium and phosphorus intake, but not for MAR. MIS correlated negatively with anthropometric parameters, fat mass, visceral fat level and trunk fat mass, and iron and uric acid in HD participants, whereas no significant correlations were found in PD participants. The estimated 10-year survival correlated with several parameters of nutritional status in HD and PD participants, as well as nutrient intake in HD participants. These results indicate a high prevalence of malnutrition and inadequate dietary intake in the Dalmatian dialysis population which, furthermore, highlights the urgent need for individualized and structural nutritional support.","['dietary intake', 'dietary recommendations', 'hemodialysis', 'malnutrition inflammation score', 'nutrient adequacy', 'nutritional status', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Nutrients,2022-09-10,"[{'lastname': 'Kolak', 'firstname': 'Ela', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, University Hospital Centre Split, 21000 Split, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Radić', 'firstname': 'Josipa', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Dialysis, University Hospital Centre Split, 21000 Split, Croatia.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Split, 21000 Split, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Vučković', 'firstname': 'Marijana', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Dialysis, University Hospital Centre Split, 21000 Split, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bučan Nenadić', 'firstname': 'Dora', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, University Hospital Centre Split, 21000 Split, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Begović', 'firstname': 'Mirna', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Student of School of Medicine, University of Split, 21000 Split, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Radić', 'firstname': 'Mislav', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Split, 21000 Split, Croatia.\nDepartment of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Centre Split, 21000 Split, Croatia.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/nu14173553

27505310",Evaluation of the SUCCESS Health Literacy App for Australian Adults With Chronic Kidney Disease: Protocol for a Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial.,"We developed a smartphone app-the SUCCESS (Supporting Culturally and Linguistically Diverse CKD Patients to Engage in Shared Decision-Making Successfully) app-to support Australian adults with kidney failure undertaking dialysis to actively participate in self-management and decision-making. The content of the SUCCESS app was informed by a theoretical model of health literacy that recognizes the importance of reducing the complexity of health information as well as providing skills necessary to access, understand, and act on this information.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the SUCCESS app intervention.
We designed a multicenter pragmatic randomized controlled trial to compare the SUCCESS app plus usual care (intervention) to usual care alone (control). A total of 384 participants receiving in-center or home-based hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis will be recruited from six local health districts in the Greater Sydney region, New South Wales, Australia. To avoid intervention contamination, a pragmatic randomization approach will be used for participants undergoing in-center dialysis, in which randomization will be based on the days they receive hemodialysis and by center (ie, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday). Participants undergoing home-based dialysis will be individually randomized centrally using simple randomization and two stratification factors: language spoken at home and research site. Consenting participants will be invited to use the SUCCESS app for 12 months. The primary endpoints, which will be assessed after 3, 6, and 12 months of app usage, are health literacy skills, evaluated using the Health Literacy Questionnaire; decision self-efficacy, evaluated using the Decision Self-Efficacy Scale; and rates of unscheduled health encounters. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcomes (ie, quality of life, evaluated with the 5-level EQ-5D; knowledge; confidence; health behavior; and self-management) and clinical outcomes (ie, symptom burden, evaluated with the Palliative care Outcome Scale-Renal; nutritional status, evaluated with the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment; and intradialytic weight gain). App engagement will be determined via app analytics. All analyses will be undertaken using an intention-to-treat approach comparing the intervention and usual care arms.
The study has been approved by Nepean Blue Mountains Human Research Ethics Committee (2020/ETH00910) and recruitment has begun at nine sites. We expect to finalize data collection by 2023 and publish the manuscript by 2024.
Enhancing health literacy skills for patients undergoing hemodialysis is an important endeavor, given the association between poor health literacy and poor health outcomes, especially among culturally diverse groups. The findings from this trial will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at conferences, and updates will be shared with partners, including participating local health districts, Kidney Health Australia, and consumers. The SUCCESS app will continue to be available to all participants following trial completion.

7841967","Translation, cultural adaptation, and validation of the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale-renal (IPOS-r) to Czech.","Patients with advanced kidney disease suffer from burdensome symptoms, which should be assessed by valid and reliable patient-reported outcome measures. This study aimed to provide a translation, cultural adaptation, and validation of the Czech version of the IPOS-r.
The IPOS-r was translated to Czech and culturally adapted using cognitive interviews. During the validation phase, patients and staff in dialysis centres and outpatient renal clinics completed the IPOS-r. Internal consistency was tested with Cronbach's alpha, its reliability via intraclass correlation coefficient for total IPOS-r score, and weighted Kappa (for test-retest and interrater reliability of individual items). Convergent validity was tested with Spearman correlation to Kidney Disease Quality of Life Survey-Short Form 1.2 (KDQOL-SF 1.2). We assessed sensitivity to change using a distribution-based approach.
Two sets of translators independently performed forward and backward translations of the IPOS-r. Ten patients and ten health care professionals participated in cognitive pre-testing. The sample size for validation included 88 patients (mean age 66 ± SD13.8; 58% men) who were treated with haemodialysis (70.5%), home haemodialysis (5.5%), peritoneal dialysis (3%), and conservative management (21%). Cronbach's alpha was 0.72, and the intraclass correlation was 0.84 for test-retest reliability and 0.73 for interrater reliability. The IPOS-r correlated with KDQOL-SF 1.2 had a rho between 0.4-0.8 for most of the IPOS-r items, showing good convergent validity. The IPOS-r measure is feasible and takes 9 minutes to complete. Patients who reported a change in health status after 1 month demonstrated a total IPOS-r score change of eight points in both positive and negative directions.
The process of translation and cultural adaptation of the IPOS-r was successful, and the Czech IPOS-r measure is a valid and reliable tool. The Czech IPOS-r can be used to assess symptoms in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

138,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,36028210,Ceftazidime encephalopathy developed without the elevation of cerebrospinal fluid concentration of ceftazidime: A case report of two cases.,"Ceftazidime encephalopathy is reported to be caused by the repeated administration of ceftazidime in patients with renal impairment because of the high serum concentration of ceftazidime. Ceftazidime encephalopathy has been considered to be caused by the elevation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration. However, as no reports have measured CSF concentrations, the relationship with ceftazidime encephalopathy and CSF concentration has not been clarified.
Case 1: An 80-year-old Japanese man under a combination therapy with peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, who had been treated for a cellulitis with ceftazidime, developed altered consciousness and was diagnosed as ceftazidime encephalopathy. His serum concentration of ceftazidime was elevated, but CSF concentration was only under 0.1 μg/mL. Case 2: An 88-year-old Japanese man with chronic kidney disease, who had been treated for a urinary tract infection with ceftazidime, developed altered consciousness and was diagnosed as ceftazidime encephalopathy. His serum concentration of ceftazidime was elevated, but CSF concentration was within the therapeutic range. However, his serum and CSF concentration of quinolinic acid was markedly increased.
Patients with renal failure are more likely to develop ceftazidime encephalopathy. We need to pay attention to the dosage of ceftazidime and to the appearance of neurological symptoms. Ceftazidime encephalopathy was considered to be caused by the high CSF concentration, but it could be caused by quinolinic acid as neurotoxic substance.","['Ceftazidime encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal fluid', 'Dialysis', 'Neurotoxicity', 'Renal failure']",Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,2022-08-27,"[{'lastname': 'Toda', 'firstname': 'Masataro', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Saiseikai Central Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoshifuji', 'firstname': 'Ayumi', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Saiseikai Central Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.

Such distress depends on various factors. We previously reported that hemodialysis patients have more psychological distress than peritoneal dialysis patients among patients on dialysis in the COVID-19 pandemic era. However, no study has reported how psychological distress related to the COVID-19 pandemic depends on renal function in the entire group of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate psychological distress and concerns related to COVID-19 according to CKD stage. This was a cross-sectional study that included 397 CKD patients who visited a hospital from August 2020 to November 2020. Patients responded to questionnaires covering depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, GAD-7), psychological impact of event (22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R), insomnia (7-item Insomnia severity Index, ISI), concerns, and precautionary measures about COVID-19. According to eGFR and dialysis status, patients were divided into three groups: (1) patients with CKD stage 1~2, (2) patients with CKD stage 3~5 without dialysis, and (3) dialysis patients.

Older adults undergoing peritoneal dialysis received eight individualised nutrition and physical activity advice sessions provided by trained nurses. Protein intake and physical activity were regarded as primary outcomes. All data were collected at baseline and at week 12. The enrolment rate was 78.4%. Twenty-nine patients participated in the study. Of these, 86.2% (25/29) completed the intervention. There was a significant increase in protein intake (t = -4.453, P< 0.001) and physical activity levels (Z = -2.929, P = 0.004). Of the participants, 56.0% achieved the targeted protein goal, and 41.4% met the physical activity goal. The timed up-and-go performance (t = 4.135, P = 0.001) increased after intervention.

33812373",A promising tool: triglyceride-glucose index to stratify the risk of cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease.,"Lipid profile management is one of the crucial components to optimize outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). CKD is associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes due to both a direct cardiovascular impact of CKD and the presence of metabolic comorbidities. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is the main target of current lipid-lowering drugs. However, the derangement of lipid metabolism in CKD is more complex. The recently described triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) is associated with cardiovascular outcomes in the general population. In recent studies, the TyG was associated with CKD progression in CKD patients and with cardiovascular death in patients on peritoneal dialysis.

142,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35998320,Armed conflicts and kidney patients: a consensus statement from the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force of the ERA.,"During conflicts, people with kidney disease, either those remaining in the affected zones or those who are displaced, may be exposed to additional threats because of medical and logistical challenges. Acute kidney injury developing on the battlefield, in field hospitals or in higher-level hospital settings is characterized by poor outcomes. People with chronic kidney disease may experience treatment interruptions, contributing to worsening kidney function. Patients living on dialysis or with a functioning graft may experience limitations of dialysis possibilities or availability of immunosuppressive medications, increasing the risk of severe complications including death. When patients must flee, these threats are compounded by unhealthy and insecure conditions both during displacement and/or at their destination. Measures to attenuate these risks may only be partially effective. Local preparedness for overall and medical/kidney-related disaster response is essential. Due to limitations in supply, adjustments in dialysis frequency or dose, switching between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis and changes in immunosuppressive regimens may be required. Telemedicine (if possible) may be useful to support inexperienced local physicians in managing medical and logistical challenges. Limited treatment possibilities during warfare may necessitate referral of patients to distant higher-level hospitals, once urgent care has been initiated. Preparation for disasters should occur ahead of time. Inclusion of disaster nephrology in medical and nursing curricula and training of patients, families and others on self-care and medical practice in austere settings may enhance awareness and preparedness, support best practices adapted to the demanding circumstances and prepare non-professionals to lend support.","['conflicts', 'dialysis', 'disasters', 'kidney patients', 'wars']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2022-08-24,"[{'lastname': 'Sever', 'firstname': 'Mehmet S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Istanbul University, School of Medicine, Department of Nephrology, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Vanholder', 'firstname': 'Raymond', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'European Kidney Health Alliance, Brussels, Belgium; Nephrology Section, Department of Internal Medicine and, Pediatrics, University Hospital Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Luyckx', 'firstname': 'Valerie', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland; Department of Paediatrics and Child, Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa; Renal Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard, Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Eckardt', 'firstname': 'Kai-Uwe', 'initials': 'KU', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Medical Intensive Care, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kolesnyk', 'firstname': 'Mykola', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'SI Institute of Nephrology of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, Ukraine.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiecek', 'firstname': 'Andrzej', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Transplantation and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pawlowicz-Szlarska', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hypertension and Kidney Transplantation, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Gallego', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'European Kidney Health Alliance, Brussels, Belgium; European Kidney Patient Federation, Wien, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Shroff', 'firstname': 'Rukshana', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Renal Unit, UCL Great Ormond Street Hospital and Institute of Child Health, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Škoberne', 'firstname': 'Andrej', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; Medical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.'}, {'lastname': 'Nistor', 'firstname': 'Ionut', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Nephrology and Geriatrics, Grigore T Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Iasi, Romania; Department of Nephrology, Dr C I Parhon University Hospital, Iasi, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Sekkarie', 'firstname': 'Mohamed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology and Hypertension Associates, Bluefield, WV, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ivanov', 'firstname': 'Dmytro', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and RRT Shupyk, National Health Care University, Kyiv, Ukraine.'}, {'lastname': 'Noruišiene', 'firstname': 'Edita', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'European Kidney Health Alliance, Brussels, Belgium; European Dialysis and Transplant Nurses Association - European Renal Care Association.'}, {'lastname': 'Tuglular', 'firstname': 'Serhan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Marmara University, School of Medicine, Department of Nephrology, Istanbul, Turkey.'}]",None,None,None,© The Author(s) 2022.

143,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35977460,Telemedicine and Clinical Outcomes in Peritoneal Dialysis: A Propensity-Matched Study.,"Telemedicine (TM) has shown to provide potential benefits on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease but limited evidences published in the peritoneal dialysis (PD) population. This study aimed to explore the long-term effects of TM on the mortality and technique failure.
The Peritoneal Dialysis Telemedicine-assisted Platform Cohort Study (PDTAP Study) was conducted prospectively in 27 hospitals in China since 2016. Patient and practice data were collected through the doctor-end of the TM app (Manburs) for all participants. TM including self-monitoring records, on-line education materials, and real-time physician-patient contact was only performed for the patient-end users of the Manburs. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were cause-specific mortality and all-cause and cause-specific permanent transfer to hemodialysis.
A total of 7,539 PD patients were enrolled between June 2016 and April 2019, with follow-up till December 2020. Patients were divided into two cohorts: TM group (39.1%) and non-TM group (60.9%). A propensity score was used to create 2,160 matched pairs in which the baseline covariates were well-balanced. There were significantly lower risks of all-cause mortality (HR 0.59 [0.51, 0.67], p < 0.001), CVD mortality (HR 0.59 [0.49, 0.70], p < 0.001), all-cause transfer to hemodialysis (0.57 [0.48, 0.67], p < 0.001), transfer to hemodialysis from PD-related infection (0.67 [0.51, 0.88], p = 0.003), severe fluid overload (0.40 [0.30, 0.55], p < 0.001), inadequate solute clearance (0.49 [0.26, 0.92], p = 0.026), and catheter-related noninfectious complications (0.41 [0.17, 0.97], p = 0.041) in the TM group compared with the non-TM group.
This study indicated real-world associations between TM usage and reduction in patient survival and technique survival through a multicenter prospective cohort.","['Mortality', 'Peritoneal dialysis',

27073310",Does Laparoscopic Omentectomy Reduce CAPD Catheter Malfunction: A Three-arm Pilot Randomized Trial.,"Catheter malfunction secondary to omental wrapping is a frequent complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Of the various methods of peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion (PDCI), open surgical insertion under local anesthesia is most widely practiced. Laparoscopic omentectomy is often undertaken as a salvage procedure in case of malfunctioning catheters. However, there is no randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the role of prophylactic laparoscopic omentectomy on catheter function. This pilot RCT was undertaken to evaluate the impact of laparoscopic omentectomy on the incidence of catheter malfunction.
Consecutive patients were randomized into three groups: laparoscopic PDCI with omentectomy (Group A), laparoscopic PDCI without omentectomy (Group B) and open surgical PDCI (Group C). The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter malfunction at 6 weeks and 3 months.
Forty-one patients completed follow-up, with 16, 11, and 14 patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Incidence of catheter malfunction was 6.2%, 27.3%, and 14.3% in Groups A, B, and C, respectively, at 6 weeks and 6.2%, 36.4%, and 21.4% at 3 months, respectively. In patients with previously failed catheter insertion (
Laparoscopic omentectomy may be associated with a lower incidence of catheter malfunction, especially in patients with previously failed peritoneal dialysis catheter. Data from this pilot RCT can be used to design a large trial with an adequate number of patients.","['CKD', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'end-stage renal disease', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'renal replacement therapy Trial registration number: CTRI/2018/02/011871']",Indian journal of nephrology,2022-08-16,"[{'lastname': 'Baksi', 'firstname': 'Aditya', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Disciplines, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Asuri', 'firstname': 'Krishna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Disciplines, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Vuthaluru', 'firstname': 'Seenu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Disciplines, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Yadav', 'firstname': 'Raj K', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Prajapati', 'firstname': 'Om Prakash', 'initials': 'OP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Disciplines, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Bansal', 'firstname': 'Virinder K', 'initials': 'VK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Disciplines, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kumar', 'firstname': 'Subodh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Disciplines, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Mahajan', 'firstname': 'Sandeep', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Bhowmik', 'firstname': 'Dipankar', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Bagga', 'firstname': 'Arvind', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Paediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Agarwal', 'firstname': 'Sanjay K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.'}]",None,None,"Forty-one patients completed follow-up, with 16, 11, and 14 patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively.

We retrospectively evaluated the short- and long-term results, as well as the feasibility of continuing PD, in eight patients with PD who had colorectal cancer surgery at our institution between January 2010 and January 2021.
The scheduled open-fashioned resection was performed in one patient, whereas the other seven surgeries were all conducted laparoscopically, with no intraoperative conversion to laparotomy necessary. Except for one patient with a history of recurring PD-related peritonitis, the PD catheter was kept in seven of the eight cases. Five of the seven patients continuing PD underwent temporary postoperative hemodialysis. At a median of 24.5 months of postoperative monitoring, no infectious complications were observed, six cases continued PD, and no recurrence of colorectal cancer was observed in all cases.
Routine curative-intent colorectal cancer surgery with the preservation of the PD catheter is possible and safe in individuals receiving PD. This patient population's short- and long-term oncological results are comparable to general surgical outcomes of those without chronic kidney disease. PD can be maintained for a long period of time following major colorectal cancer surgery.","['colorectal cancer surgery', 'end-stage kidney disease', 'end-stage renal disease', 'perioperative management', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'surgical outcome']",Cureus,2022-08-13,"[{'lastname': 'Kouno', 'firstname': 'Nobuji', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Surgery, Kokura Memorial Hospital, Kitakyushu, JPN.'}, {'lastname': 'Takahashi', 'firstname': 'Ryo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Surgery, Kokura Memorial Hospital, Kitakyushu, JPN.'}, {'lastname': 'Furuya', 'firstname': 'Takumi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Surgery, Kokura Memorial Hospital, Kitakyushu, JPN.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujikawa', 'firstname': 'Takahisa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Surgery, Kokura Memorial Hospital, Kitakyushu, JPN.'}]",None,None,"The scheduled open-fashioned resection was performed in one patient, whereas the other seven surgeries were all conducted laparoscopically, with no intraoperative conversion to laparotomy necessary.

Except for the sham-operated group, ESRD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy in the other three groups. The PD group and UCG group were then subjected to PD. In addition, the UCG group was given UCG by gavage when PD. Changes in body weight and final kidney weight of rats in each group were monitored. HE and Masson staining were performed to confirm the extent of renal fibrosis. Biochemical kits were used to detect blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum and urine creatinine (Scr, Cre), and urine protein (UPr) levels. ELISA was used to detect the rats' inflammatory responses. qRT-PCR, WB, and IHC were probed to determine the expression levels of NF-κB and MAPK. 16S rDNA sequencing was performed to analyze the composition of gut microbiota in rats. A liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer was performed to reveal serum metabolomics changes.
UCG increased renal volume and body weight, improved renal fibrosis. It enhanced renal function and decreased the levels of BUN, Scr, Upr, Cre, inflammatory responses, as well as NF-κB and MAPK expressions in renal and colon tissues of ESRD rats. The relative abundances of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes changed in ESRD rats in response to UCG. Serum metabolomics was utilized to identify 70 differentiated metabolites, which were associated with D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, and Phenylalanine metabolism.
Our study confirmed that UCG alleviated ESRD by regulating p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, microbial and metabolic profiles.","['end-stage renal disease', 'gut microbiota', 'p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway', 'uremic clearance granules']","Drug design, development and therapy",2022-08-11,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xiaosheng', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Jie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jian', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Xianhu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Fengxia', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Shufeng', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liao', 'firstname': 'Yunqiang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""First Clinical Medical College of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Xiaoqing', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Wenjuan', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, People's Republic of China.""}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Yang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, 341000, People's Republic of China.""}]",None,"Our study confirmed that UCG alleviated ESRD by regulating p38 MAPK/NF-κB signaling pathway, microbial and metabolic profiles.","UCG increased renal volume and body weight, improved renal fibrosis.

28455661",Success rates and safety of a modified percutaneous PD catheter placement technique: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous placement of peritoneal dialysis catheters using a multifunctional bladder paracentesis trocar.,"We modified the blind Seldinger technique by incorporating ultrasound guidance and the use of a multifunctional bladder paracentesis trocar for PD catheter (PDC) placement, which can be easily performed by a nephrologist and is a feasible technique. To compare success rates and safety of our modified percutaneous PD catheter placement technique to open surgery.
Two hundred and twelve stage-5 chronic kidney disease(CKD) patients receiving PD therapy from June 2016 to June 2019 were included, 105 patients treated by ultrasound-guided percutaneous placement of peritoneal dialysis catheters using a multifunctional bladder paracentesis trocar (Group A) and 107 patients receiving open surgical placement (Group B). Outcomes of patients via either catheter placement technique were retrospectively compared. The clinical success rate as defined by proper catheter drainage within 4 weeks after placement, complication rates (both technical complications and infections), and 1-year catheter survival were compared.
There was no significant difference in sex ratio, age, or previous abdominal surgery history between groups (P > .05). Both surgical time and incision length were significantly shorter in Group A than in Group B (P < .05). Clinical success rate was also higher inGroup A (P < .05). Moreover, Group A demonstrated lower overall complication rates (P < .05) and lower incidence rates of early peritonitis, initial drainage disorder, and peritubular leakage (all P < .05). One-year catheter survival was also higher in Group A (P < .05).

Herein, a rapid, sensitive and robust method based on ultra-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was developed and validated for the determination of the concentrations of valsartan, sacubitril and its major metabolite LBQ657 in plasma, urine and peritoneal dialysis fluid. Samples were extracted from various biological fluids using protein precipitation. Extracts were subjected to UPLC-MS/MS with electrospray ionization in positive-ion mode. The developed method was fully validated over a concentration range of 8.00-8000 ng/mL for valsartan, 2.00-2000 ng/mL for sacubitril and 30.0-30,000 ng/mL for LBQ657 in plasma, 2.00-1000 ng/mL for valsartan, 1.00-500 ng/mL for sacubitril and 20.0-10000 ng/mL for LBQ657 in urine, and 0.200-100 ng/mL for valsartan, 0.0400-20.0 ng/mL for sacubitril and 2.00-1000 ng/mL for LBQ657 in peritoneal dialysis fluid. The intra- and inter-day precisions for all analytes in various matrices were less than 12.3%, and the intra- and inter-day accuracies results were all between 88.0% and 109.2%. All analytes were stable for at least 8 h at room temperature (25°C), five freeze-thaw cycles, and 37 days at -40°C and -80°C in plasma, urine and peritoneal dialysis fluid. In conclusion, this developed method is reliable, sensitive and specific for determining the concentrations of valsartan, sacubitril and LBQ657 in plasma, urine and peritoneal dialysis fluid. The assay was available to pilot the pharmacokinetics study of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, and it could provide evidence that peritoneal dialysis had an effect on the clearance of sacubitril/valsartan.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Sacubitril', 'UPLC–MS/MS', 'Validation', 'Valsartan']","Journal of chromatography.

151,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35927791,Impact of different COVID-19 waves on kidney replacement therapy epidemiology and mortality: REMER 2020.,"Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) confers the highest risk of death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, most data refer to the early pandemic waves. Whole-year analysis compared with prior secular trends are scarce.
We present the 2020 REMER Madrid KRT registry, corresponding to the Spanish Region hardest hit by COVID-19.
In 2020, KRT incidence decreased 12% versus 2019, while KRT prevalence decreased by 1.75% for the first time since records began and the number of kidney transplants (KTs) decreased by 16%. Mortality on KRT was 10.2% (34% higher than the mean for 2008-2019). The 2019-2020 increase in mortality was larger for KTs (+68%) than for haemodialysis (+24%) or peritoneal dialysis (+38%). The most common cause of death was infection [n = 419 (48% of deaths)], followed by cardiovascular [n = 200 (23%)]. Deaths from infection increased by 167% year over year and accounted for 95% of excess deaths in 2020 over 2019. COVID-19 was the most common cause of death (68% of infection deaths, 33% of total deaths). The bulk of COVID-19 deaths [209/285 (73%)] occurred during the first COVID-19 wave, which roughly accounted for the increased mortality in 2020. Being a KT recipient was an independent risk factor for COVID-19 death.
COVID-19 negatively impacted the incidence and prevalence of KRT, but the increase in KRT deaths was localized to the first wave of the pandemic. The increased annual mortality argues against COVID-19 accelerating the death of patients with short life expectancy and the temporal pattern of COVID-19 mortality suggests that appropriate healthcare may improve outcomes.","['COVID-19', 'chronic kidney disease', 'haemodialysis', 'kidney replacement therapy', 'kidney transplantation', 'mortality', 'peritoneal dialysis']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2022-08-06,"[{'lastname': 'Carriazo', 'firstname': 'Sol', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.\nRICORS2040, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Aparicio-Madre', 'firstname': 'Manuel I', 'initials': 'MI', 'affiliation': 'REMER, Oficina Regional de Coordinación de Trasplantes de la Comunidad de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Tornero-Molina', 'firstname': 'Fernando', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Sureste, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernández-Lucas', 'firstname': 'Milagros', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal, Universidad de Alcalá, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Paraiso-Cuevas', 'firstname': 'Vicente', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Henares, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'González-Parra', 'firstname': 'Emilio', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.\nRICORS2040, Madrid, Spain.\nDepartamento de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Del Río-Gallegos', 'firstname': 'Francisco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'REMER, Oficina Regional de Coordinación de Trasplantes de la Comunidad de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Marques-Vidas', 'firstname': 'María', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Hospital Puerta de Hierro, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Alcázar-Arroyo', 'firstname': 'Roberto', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Infanta Leonor, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Martins-Muñoz', 'firstname': 'Judith', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital de Getafe, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Sánchez-Villanueva', 'firstname': 'Rafael', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gil-Casares', 'firstname': 'Beatriz', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital del Sureste, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gutiérrez-Martínez', 'firstname': 'Eduardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Martínez-Rubio', 'firstname': 'María Pilar', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'Centro de Diálisis El Pilar, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ortiz', 'firstname': 'Alberto', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, IIS-Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.\nRICORS2040, Madrid, Spain.\nDepartamento de Medicina, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,"In 2020, KRT incidence decreased 12% versus 2019, while KRT prevalence decreased by 1.75% for the first time since records began and the number of kidney transplants (KTs) decreased by 16%.

32251668",Peritoneal dialysis in the era of COVID-19: experience of a Tunisian center.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the health landscape by hampering the management of patients with chronic diseases. Providing optimal healthcare has become a critical issue, especially for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving in-center dialysis. Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) has the advantage of being a home-based therapy. Several papers about COVID-19 in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population have been published, but few studies focused on the PD population, with limited case series. In this paper, we share our strategy for managing PD patients during the pandemic and describe the characteristics of 24 episodes of COVID-19 that occurred in our PD patients. Also, we report the impact of the pandemic on different outcomes and discuss the challenges of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the time of COVID-19 and the advantages of PD. During the period from December 2019 to September 2021, 127 patients received PD in our center. Among them, we recorded 24 episodes of COVID-19 that occurred in 20 patients, corresponding to an incidence of 8.4 per 1000 patient-months. None of the 20 patients with COVID-19 were vaccinated and there was a significant male gender predominance in the COVID-19 group compared to the non-COVID-19 group. The prevalence of diabetic nephropathy and primary glomerulonephritis were also significantly higher in the COVID-19 group. The revealing symptoms were asthenia, dry cough, and the deterioration of general conditions in 100%, 75%, and 63% of the patients, respectively. A biological inflammatory syndrome was found in 30% of the patients. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan, performed in 5 patients, showed features of COVID pneumonia with an average extent of damage of 55%. The rate of patients starting PD during the study period was comparable to that before the pandemic. Furthermore, we did not find a significant difference between the infected and the non-infected groups regarding the incidence of peritonitis, PD technique failure, and mortality (6.1 [0-1.46] vs 3.9 [0.15-0.64] deaths per 1000 patient-months. COVID-19 does not seem to have influenced the outcomes of our patients treated with PD even before the launch of mass immunization in our country. Thus, PD can be a great option for RRT in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic since many issues could be managed remotely to avoid regular hospital visits and contribute to maintaining social distancing, which is the cornerstone of breaking the chain of transmission of the novel virus.","['COVID-19', 'Management', 'Pandemic', 'Peritoneal dialysis']",Journal of nephrology,2022-08-02,"[{'lastname': 'Badrouchi', 'firstname': 'Samarra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine ""A"", Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. samarra.nephro@gmail.com.\nUniversity of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia. samarra.nephro@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Barbouch', 'firstname': 'Samia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine ""A"", Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.\nUniversity of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.\nLaboratory of Renal Pathology (LR00SP01), Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bettaieb', 'firstname': 'Asma', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine ""A"", Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.\nUniversity of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sellami', 'firstname': 'Nada', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine ""A"", Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.\nUniversity of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.\nLaboratory of Renal Pathology (LR00SP01), Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hajji', 'firstname': 'Mariem', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine ""A"", Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.\nUniversity of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ben Abdallah', 'firstname': 'Taieb', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine ""A"", Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.\nUniversity of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.\nLaboratory of Kidney Transplantation Immunology and Immunopathology (LR03SP01), Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ben Hamida', 'firstname': 'Fethi', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine ""A"", Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.\nUniversity of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.\nLaboratory of Renal Pathology (LR00SP01), Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.'}, {'lastname': 'Harzallah', 'firstname': 'Amel', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine ""A"", Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.\nUniversity of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.'}, {'lastname': 'Abderrahim', 'firstname': 'Ezzedine', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine ""A"", Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia.\nUniversity of Tunis El Manar, Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.'}]",None,None,None,© 2022.

154,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35906334,Gut microbiota profile of patients on peritoneal dialysis: comparison with household contacts.,"Differences in patients gut microbiota composition with the potential for dysbiosis have been associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, factors other than the disease itself, such as diet and cohabitation, have not been evaluated when gut microbiota of CKD patients was compared with that of healthy controls. The aim of this study was to compare the gut microbiota composition between patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and age-matched household contacts with normal renal function.
Fecal samples were collected from 20 patients [men: 70%; age: 53.5 years (48.2-66; median and interquartile range); length on PD: 14 months (5.2-43.5) and 20 controls. The region V4 of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was PCR-amplified and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq platform. Dietary intake and diet quality were assessed by a 3-day food record and a diet quality index, respectively.
No difference was found between the gut microbiota composition of patients and controls, assessed by alpha and beta diversities (p > 0.05) and genera differential abundance (p > 0.05). The most abundant phyla in both groups were Firmicutes (PD = 45%; Control: 47%; p = 0.65) and Bacteroidetes (PD = 41%; Control: 45%; p = 0.17). The phylum Proteobacteria, known as a potential marker of gut dysbiosis, was not different in proportions between groups (p > 0.05). No difference was observed regarding diet quality and dietary intake of fiber, protein and other nutrients (p > 0.05).

28038804",Association of Albumin and Globulin with Mortality Risk in Incident Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.,"Background: Nutrition and inflammation have been implicated in predicting mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Serum albumin and globulin can be regarded for the nutritional and inflammatory status. However, there is lack of data to evaluate the synergistic effect of albumin and globulin on mortality prediction. Methods: In 554 patients initiating PD from January 2001 to July 2016, we divided them into four groups by the combination of two categories of low vs. high albumin and low vs. high globulin. The median values for albumin and globulin were chosen to classify them into low or high groups. Their associations with all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality were examined in Cox regression models adjusted for confounding clinical and laboratory data. Results: Patients, 52.91 ± 15.2 years old and 47.8% men, had a median (interquartile range) value of 3.3 (2.9−3.8) g/dL for albumin and 2.8 (2.5−3.2) g/dL for globulin, respectively. Patients with low albumin and high globulin had the highest all-cause mortality and CV mortality, with adjusted hazard ratios of 3.87 (95% CI 1.83−8.20, p < 0.001) and 5.65 (95% CI 2.23−14.34, p < 0.001), respectively, compared with those with a high albumin and low globulin having the lowest mortality rate. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed this relationship. Conclusions: A patient profile of either low albumin or high globulin is linked to a higher risk for mortality, particularly for a profile of both low albumin and high globulin compared with one without either of them. Further studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and how to improve clinical outcomes in those high-risk patients.","['albumin', 'cardiovascular disease', 'chronic kidney disease', 'globulin', 'mortality', 'peritoneal dialysis (PD)']",Nutrients,2022-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Kuan-Ju', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua 50006, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hsieh', 'firstname': 'Yao-Peng', 'initials': 'YP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua 50006, Taiwan.\nSchool of Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 80708, Taiwan.\nSchool of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung 40201, Taiwan.\nCollege of Life Sciences, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung 402, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chiu', 'firstname': 'Ping-Fang', 'initials': 'PF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua 50006, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Recreation and Holistic Wellness, MingDao University, Changhua 52345, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Pei-Ru', 'initials': 'PR', 'affiliation': 'Big Data Center, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua 50006, Taiwan.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/nu14142850

31160369",Main Barriers to the Introduction of a Home Haemodialysis Programme in Poland: A Review of the Challenges for Implementation and Criteria for a Successful Programme.,"Home dialysis in Poland is restricted to the peritoneal dialysis (PD) modality, with the majority of dialysis patients treated using in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD). Home haemodialysis (HHD) is an additional home therapy to PD and provides an attractive alternative to ICHD that combines dialysis with social distancing; eliminates transportation needs; and offers clinical, economic, and quality of life benefits. However, HHD is not currently provided in Poland. This review was performed to provide an overview of the main barriers to the introduction of a HHD programme in Poland.
The main high-level barrier to introducing HHD in Poland is the absence of specific health legislation required for clinician prescribing of HHD. Other barriers to overcome include clear definition of reimbursement, patient training and education (including infrastructure and experienced personnel), organisation of logistics, and management of complications. Partnering with a large care network for HHD represents an alternative option to payers for the provision of a new HHD service. This may reduce some of the barriers which need to be overcome when compared with the creation of a new HHD service and its supporting network due to the pre-existing infrastructure, processes, and staff of a large care network.
Provision of HHD is not solely about the provision of home treatment, but also the organisation and definition of a range of support services that are required to deliver the service. HHD should be viewed as an additional, complementary option to existing dialysis modalities which enables choice of modality best suited to a patient's needs.","['COVID-19', 'chronic kidney disease (CKD)', 'end-stage renal disease (ESRD)', 'home haemodialysis (HHD)', 'in-centre haemodialysis (ICHD)', 'large care networks', 'peritoneal dialysis (PD)', 'renal replacement therapy (RRT)']",Journal of clinical medicine,2022-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Kendzia', 'firstname': 'Dana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Else Kroener Str. 1, 61352 Bad Homburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lima', 'firstname': 'Federica', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Else Kroener Str. 1, 61352 Bad Homburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zawierucha', 'firstname': 'Jacek', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Fresenius Medical Care Poland, 60-118 Poznań, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Busink', 'firstname': 'Ellen', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Else Kroener Str. 1, 61352 Bad Homburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Apel', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Else Kroener Str. 1, 61352 Bad Homburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Malyszko', 'firstname': 'Jacek Stanislaw', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': '1st Department of Nephrology and Transplantology, Medical University of Białystok, Żurawia 14, 15-540 Białystok, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Zebrowski', 'firstname': 'Pawel', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1A, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Malyszko', 'firstname': 'Jolanta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Banacha 1A, 02-097 Warsaw, Poland.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/jcm11144166

32489134",Vascular Calcification and the Gut and Blood Microbiome in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients on Peritoneal Dialysis: A Pilot Study.,"Vascular calcification (VC) is a frequent condition in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a well-established risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Gut dysbiosis may contribute to CVD and inflammation in CKD patients. Nonetheless, the role of gut and blood microbiomes in CKD-associated VC remains unknown. Therefore, this pilot study aimed to explore the link between gut and blood microbiomes and VC in CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis (CKD-PD). Our results showed relative changes in specific taxa between CKD-PD patients with and without VC, namely Coprobacter, Coprococcus 3, Lactobacillus, and Eubacterium eligens group in the gut, and Cutibacterium, Pajaroellobacter, Devosia, Hyphomicrobium, and Pelomonas in the blood. An association between VC and all-cause mortality risk in CKD-PD patients was also observed, and patients with higher mortality risk corroborate the changes of Eubacterium eligens in the gut and Devosia genus in the blood. Although we did not find differences in uremic toxins, intestinal translocation markers, and inflammatory parameters among CKD-PD patients with and without VC, soluble CD14 (sCD14), a nonspecific marker of monocyte activation, positively correlated with VC severity. Therefore, gut Eubacterium eligens group, blood Devosia, and circulating sCD14 should be further explored as biomarkers for VC, CVD, and mortality risk in CKD.","['blood microbiome', 'chronic kidney disease', 'gut microbiome', 'mortality risk', 'sCD14', 'vascular calcification']",Biomolecules,2022-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Merino-Ribas', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology & Infectious Diseases R & D Group, i3S-Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, INEB-Instituto de Engenharia Biomédica, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.\nDepartament de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08035 Barcelona, Spain.\nNephrology Department, Hospital Universitari de Girona Doctor Josep Trueta, 17007 Girona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Araujo', 'firstname': 'Ricardo', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology & Infectious Diseases R & D Group, i3S-Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, INEB-Instituto de Engenharia Biomédica, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'Luciano', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology & Infectious Diseases R & D Group, i3S-Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, INEB-Instituto de Engenharia Biomédica, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.\nNephrology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, 4200-319 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Campos', 'firstname': 'Joana', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology & Infectious Diseases R & D Group, i3S-Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, INEB-Instituto de Engenharia Biomédica, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Barreiros', 'firstname': 'Luísa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'LAQV, REQUIMTE, Departamento de Ciências Químicas, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Segundo', 'firstname': 'Marcela A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'LAQV, REQUIMTE, Departamento de Ciências Químicas, Faculdade de Farmácia, Universidade do Porto, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Silva', 'firstname': 'Nádia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, 4200-319 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Costa', 'firstname': 'Carolina F F A', 'initials': 'CFFA', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology & Infectious Diseases R & D Group, i3S-Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, INEB-Instituto de Engenharia Biomédica, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.\nInstituto de Ciências Biomédicas Abel Salazar, Universidade do Porto, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Quelhas-Santos', 'firstname': 'Janete', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'UnIC@RISE- Cardiovascular Research and Development Centre, Department of Surgery and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, 4200-319 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Trindade', 'firstname': 'Fábio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'UnIC@RISE- Cardiovascular Research and Development Centre, Department of Surgery and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, 4200-319 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Falcão-Pires', 'firstname': 'Inês', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'UnIC@RISE- Cardiovascular Research and Development Centre, Department of Surgery and Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, 4200-319 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Alencastre', 'firstname': 'Ines', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology & Infectious Diseases R & D Group, i3S-Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, INEB-Instituto de Engenharia Biomédica, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Dumitrescu', 'firstname': 'Ioana Bancu', 'initials': 'IB', 'affiliation': 'Departament de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08035 Barcelona, Spain.\nFresenius Nephrocare, 110372 Pitesti, Romania.'}, {'lastname': 'Sampaio-Maia', 'firstname': 'Benedita', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology & Infectious Diseases R & D Group, i3S-Instituto de Investigação e Inovação em Saúde, INEB-Instituto de Engenharia Biomédica, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135 Porto, Portugal.\nFaculdade de Medicina Dentária, Universidade do Porto, 4200-393 Porto, Portugal.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/biom12070867

Prospective observational cohort study including 144 participants on haemodialysis (HD) (
Anti-S antibodies at 15D and 3M were detectable in 95% (48/50)/98% (49/50) of HD patients, 93% (13/14)/100% of PD patients, 67% (17/26)/75% (21/28) of KT patients and 96% (25/26)/100% (24/24) of ACKD patients. Rates for healthy controls were 81% (13/16)/100% (17/17). Previous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2-S) infection was documented in four (7.7%) HD patients, two (14.3%) PD patients, two (6.7%) KT patients, one (5.55%) healthy control and in no ACKD patient. Antibody levels decreased at 3M in HD (
Most HD, PD and ACKD patients develop SARS-CoV-2-S antibody responses comparable to that of healthy controls, in contrast to KT recipients. Antibody waning at 3M was faster in HD, PD and ACKD patients. No differences in SARS-CoV-2 T-cell immunity responses were noticed across study groups.","['SARS-CoV-2-S T-cells', 'SARS-CoV-2-S antibodies', 'chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'kidney transplantation']",Clinical kidney journal,2022-07-27,"[{'lastname': 'Panizo', 'firstname': 'Nayara', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institutue, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Albert', 'firstname': 'Eliseo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Giménez-Civera', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institutue, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Puchades', 'firstname': 'Maria Jesús', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institutue, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': ""D'Marco"", 'firstname': 'Luis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Universidad Cardenal Herrera-CEU, CEU Universities, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gandía-Salmerón', 'firstname': 'Lorena', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institutue, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Giménez', 'firstname': 'Estela', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Torre', 'firstname': 'Ignacio', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Sancho', 'firstname': 'Asunción', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Transplant Unit, Hospital Universitario Dr. Peset, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gavela', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Transplant Unit, Hospital Universitario Dr. Peset, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gonzalez-Rico', 'firstname': 'Miguel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institutue, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Montomoli', 'firstname': 'Marco', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institutue, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Perez-Baylach', 'firstname': 'Carmen Maria', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'B BraumAvitum Hemodialysis Centres Valnefron Valencia and Massamagrell, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Bonilla', 'firstname': 'Begoña', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'B BraumAvitum Hemodialysis Centres Valnefron Valencia and Massamagrell, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Solano', 'firstname': 'Camila', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institutue, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Alvarado', 'firstname': 'Mª Fernanda', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institutue, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Torregrosa', 'firstname': 'Isidro', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institutue, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Alcaraz', 'firstname': 'María Jesús', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Górriz', 'firstname': 'José Luis', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institutue, Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Navarro', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Microbiology Service, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valencia, INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain.'}]",None,None,"Anti-S antibodies at 15D and 3M were detectable in 95% (48/50)/98% (49/50) of HD patients, 93% (13/14)/100% of PD patients, 67% (17/26)/75% (21/28) of KT patients and 96% (25/26)/100% (24/24) of ACKD patients.

26378978",Multimodal Strategies for the Diagnosis and Management of Refractory Congestion. An Integrated Cardiorenal Approach.,"Refractory congestion is common in acute and chronic heart failure, and it significantly impacts functional class, renal function, hospital admissions, and survival. In this paper, the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in cardiorenal syndrome and the interplay between heart failure and chronic kidney disease are reviewed. Although the physical exam remains key in identifying congestion, new tools such as biomarkers or lung, vascular, and renal ultrasound are currently being used to detect subclinical forms and can potentially impact its management. Thus, an integrated multimodal diagnostic algorithm is proposed. There are several strategies for treating congestion, although data on their efficacy are scarce and have not been validated. Herein, we review the optimal use and monitorization of different diuretic types, administration route, dose titration using urinary volume and natriuresis, and a sequential diuretic scheme to achieve a multitargeted nephron blockade, common adverse events, and how to manage them. In addition, we discuss alternative strategies such as subcutaneous furosemide, hypertonic saline, and albumin infusions and the available evidence of their role in congestion management. We also discuss the use of extracorporeal therapies, such as ultrafiltration, peritoneal dialysis, or conventional hemodialysis, in patients with normal or impaired renal function. This review results from a multidisciplinary view involving both nephrologists and cardiologists.","['diuretic resistance', 'extracorporeal ultrafiltration', 'heart failure', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'refractory congestion']",Frontiers in physiology,2022-07-26,"[{'lastname': 'Rodríguez-Espinosa', 'firstname': 'Diana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Guzman-Bofarull', 'firstname': 'Joan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'De La Fuente-Mancera', 'firstname': 'Juan Carlos', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Maduell', 'firstname': 'Francisco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Broseta', 'firstname': 'José Jesús', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Farrero', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiology, Hospital Clínic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2022 Rodríguez-Espinosa, Guzman-Bofarull, De La Fuente-Mancera, Maduell, Broseta and Farrero.","10.3389/fphys.2022.913580

17569716","Utility of continuous performance test (MOXO-CPT) in children with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease, dialysis and kidney transplantation.","Children with chronic kidney disease and on kidney replacement therapy may have neurocognitive and psychosocial disorders. Although kidney transplantation improves quality of life, psychological problems may exist in children who undergo kidney transplantation. Herein, we aimed to investigate attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder-like symptoms with MOXO-continuous performance test in children with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease, dialysis and kidney transplantation.
The MOXO-continuous performance test measures four domains of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder-like symptoms, including attention, timeliness, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Patients with at least three scores < - 1.5 standard deviations were considered as positive to MOXO-continuous performance test. Test scores of the pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease, dialysis (divided into peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis subgroups) and kidney transplantation groups were compared. Correlations of test scores with the patient's clinical and laboratory characteristics and effects of hospitalizations and schooling were assessed.
Seventy-two patients aged 13.3 ± 3.4 years (23 with kidney transplantation, 23 on dialysis and 26 with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease) were evaluated. Overall MOXO-continuous performance test positivity was 29%. No differences were detected between the three groups concerning total or z scores. Attention and timeliness z scores were significantly higher in females (p = 0.004 and p = 0.008, respectively). Age was positively correlated to attention and timeliness total scores (p = 0.000, r = 0.445 and p = 0.004, r = 0.243, respectively), and inversely correlated to hyperactivity total scores (p = 0.000, r = - 0.415).
Prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder-like symptoms in the study population was much higher than that of pediatric attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. We believe that the MOXO-continuous performance test is a valid supportive measure for evaluation of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis in children with various stages of chronic kidney disease or on kidney replacement therapy.","['Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Kidney transplantation', 'MOXO-continuous performance test']",Journal of nephrology,2022-07-24,"[{'lastname': 'Büyükkaragöz', 'firstname': 'Bahar', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Gazi University, Beşevler, Ankara, Turkey. karamanbahar@yahoo.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Soysal Acar', 'firstname': 'A Şebnem', 'initials': 'AŞ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Ekim', 'firstname': 'Mesiha', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Bayrakçı', 'firstname': 'Umut Selda', 'initials': 'US', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Ankara City Hospital, Children's Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.""}, {'lastname': 'Bülbül', 'firstname': 'Mehmet', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Dr. Sami Ulus Children's and Maternity Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.""}, {'lastname': 'Çaltık Yılmaz', 'firstname': 'Aysun', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Başkent University, Ankara, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Bakkaloğlu', 'firstname': 'Sevcan A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Gazi University, Beşevler, Ankara, Turkey.'}]",None,None,"Seventy-two patients aged 13.3 ± 3.4 years (23 with kidney transplantation, 23 on dialysis and 26 with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease) were evaluated.

18349556",Comparison of gastrointestinal symptoms and findings in renal replacement therapy modalities.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects gastrointestinal system (GIS) and causes histological, functional and mucosal changes. There are scarce data investigating GIS symptoms and findings in patients with CKD stage III-V, receiving hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). In this study, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms and findings and compare between renal replacement therapies.
A total of 290 patients (97 in CKD stage III-V, 92 PD, 101 HD) were included in this study. Gastrointestinal complaints, diseases, background characteristics of patients and drugs they used were questioned by interviews, forms were filled and examinations of patients were performed. Results of upper GIS endoscopy, colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasonography and tomography of patients were evaluated.
The most common signs were dyspepsia (50%), nausea (45%) and epigastric pain (44%) among all patients, generally. Gastrointestinal disorders like gastritis (62%) and gastroesophageal reflux (39%) were frequent in patients. Prevalence of patients with weight loss was 20% in predialysis and 8% in PD and the ratio was higher in predialysis group statistically significantly (p = 0,016). The prevalence of gastritis was 70% in PD, 55% in HD and the prevalence of hemorrhoids was 24% in PD and 12% in HD. The prevalence of gastritis and hemorrhoids was higher in the PD group than in the HD group statistically significantly (p = 0.043, p = 0.028), otherwise, there wasn't a difference between the PD and predialysis groups, statistically significantly.
This study showed that; gastrointestinal symptoms and disorders were very common in CKD, besides this; while gastritis and hemorrhoids were more frequent in the PD, esophagitis and hiatal hernia were more frequent in the HD.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Gastrointestinal symptoms', 'Hemodialysis', 'Peritoneal dialysis']",BMC nephrology,2022-07-24,"[{'lastname': 'Karahan', 'firstname': 'Doğu', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Departmant of Internal Medicine, Malatya Turgut Özal University School of Medicine, Malatya Training and Research Hospital, Özalper.

18344238",On the importance of the interplay of residual renal function with clinical outcomes in end-stage kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most important public health concerns of the century, and is associated with high rates of morbidity, mortality and social costs. CKD evolving towards end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) is on the rise resulting in a greater number of patients requiring peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD). The aim of this manuscript is to review the current literature on the interplay of residual renal function (RRF) with clinical outcomes in ESKD. The persistence of RRF is one of the most important predictors of decreased morbidity, mortality, and better quality of life in both PD and HD patients. RRF contributes to the well-being of ESKD patients through various mechanisms including higher clearance of solutes, maintenance of fluid balance, removal of uremic toxins and control of electrolytes. Furthermore, RRF has beneficial effects on inflammation, anemia, malnutrition, diabetes mellitus, obesity, changes in the microbiota, and cardiac diseases. Several strategies have been proposed to preserve RRF, such as blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, better blood pressure control, incremental PD and HD. Several clinical trials investigating the issue of preservation of RRF are ongoing. They are needed to broaden our understanding of the interplay of RRF with clinical outcomes in ESKD.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'End-stage kidney disease', 'Hemodialysis', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Residual renal function']",Journal of nephrology,2022-07-13,"[{'lastname': 'Tanriover', 'firstname': 'Cem', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Koc University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Ucku', 'firstname': 'Duygu', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Koc University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': 'Basile', 'firstname': 'Carlo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Associazione Nefrologica Gabriella Sebastio, Martina Franca, Italy. basile.miulli@libero.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Tuttle', 'firstname': 'Katherine R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.\nProvidence Medical Research Center, Providence Health Care, Washington, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kanbay', 'firstname': 'Mehmet', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Koc University School of Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.'}]",None,None,None,© 2022.

The risk of falls and bone fractures increases with frailty and sarcopenia. As such we wished to review the association between osteoporosis and frailty and loss of appendicular lean mass (ALM).
Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to measure lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition. Osteoporosis and osteopenia were defined according to T scores. ALM was indexed to height (ALMI). Frailty was classified using the clinical frailty scale (CFS).
DXA scans from 573 patients, 57.8% male, 36.8% diabetic, mean age 61.0 ± 15.8 years, with a median 6.0 (2-20) months of treatment with PD were reviewed. Forty-two (7.3%) were classified as clinically frail, 115 (20%) osteoporotic, and 198 (34.6%) ALMI meeting sarcopenic criteria, with 43% of osteoporotic patients being osteosarcopenic. In a multivariable model, femoral neck BMD was associated with weight, standardised β (St β) 0.29, p = 0.004, ALM St β 0.11, p = 0.03 and Black vs other ethnicities St β 0.19, p = 0.02, and negatively with age St β -0.24, p < 0.001, and frailty St β -2.1, p = 0.04. Z scores (adjusted for gender and age) were associated with ALMI (r = 0.18, p < 0.001).
Osteoporosis is increasing with the numbers of elderly dialysis patients. As frailty and sarcopenia increase with age, then the risk of falls and bone fractures increases with osteosarcopenia. Whether interventions with exercise and nutrition can improve bone heath remains to be determined.","['DXA', 'Diabetes', 'Ethnicity', 'Gender', 'Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis', 'Peritoneal dialysis']",Journal of nephrology,2022-07-12,"[{'lastname': 'Davenport', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Royal Free Hospital, UCL, University College London Medical School, London, UK. a.davenport@ucl.ac.uk.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL, University College London, Rowland Hill Street, London, NW3 2PF, UK. a.davenport@ucl.ac.uk.'}]",None,None,"DXA scans from 573 patients, 57.8% male, 36.8% diabetic, mean age 61.0 ± 15.8 years, with a median 6.0 (2-20) months of treatment with PD were reviewed.

18511606","Clinico-Epidemiological Profile of Dialysis Services in Karnataka, India - A Multicentric Exploratory Study.","New challenges in dialysis care delivery confront caregivers with the rise in dialysis numbers. There are significant lacunae in the knowledge and efficient application of dialysis therapy in the absence of a dialysis registry. This multicentric study was conducted by the Nephrology Association of Karnataka to systematically study patient demographics and dialysis characteristics in Karnataka state, India, as a basis for a statewide dialysis registry.
Data were collected from the consenting dialysis centers after institutional ethics board clearances. Residents of Karnataka state, who were confirmed prevalent patients with end-stage renal disease, on either maintenance hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis were included. Demographic data of patients and details of dialysis as well as dialysis facilities were collected on an online platform. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software Version 16.
Thirty-two centers contributed to the data of 2,050 patients (males 70.3%, mean age 53.49 ± 14.09 years). Most patients were on HD (95.3%). Diabetes was the commonest cause of chronic kidney disease. About 72% of patients had temporary venous catheters as initial vascular access. In all, 1,156 patients (59.9%) were on thrice weekly HD. Around 65% of the centers were in private hospitals. The majority (90%) of the centers reused dialyzers, 56% reprocessed dialyzers mechanically, and 66% tested viral serology quarterly.
This study was one of the initial attempts to capture dialysis data across Karnataka, and it offers useful insight into the existing dialysis demographics and care delivery. Participation of more centers and continued effort to form a dialysis registry for deriving meaningful clinico-epidemiological insight are desirable.","['Dialysis care delivery', 'India', 'Karnataka', 'NAK', 'dialysis registry', 'epidemiologic profile']",Indian journal of nephrology,2022-07-12,"[{'lastname': 'Conjeevaram', 'firstname': 'Arvind', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Sagar Hospitals, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Anupama', 'firstname': 'Y J', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Nanjappa Hospital, Shivamogga, Karnataka, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Vincent', 'firstname': 'Lloyd', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Director, Africa Healthcare Network, Port Louise, Mauritius.'}, {'lastname': 'Sastry', 'firstname': 'Nandakumar B', 'initials': 'NB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine, M.

7474243",Palliative Care for Patients with Kidney Disease.,"Interest in palliative care has increased in recent times, particularly in its multidisciplinary approach developed to meet the needs of patients with a life-threatening disease and their families. Although the modern concept of palliative simultaneous care postulates the adoption of these qualitative treatments early on during the life-threatening disease (and potentially just after the diagnosis), palliative care is still reserved for patients at the end of their life in most of the clinical realities, and thus is consequently mistaken for hospice care. Patients with acute or chronic kidney disease (CKD) usually experience poor quality of life and decreased survival expectancy and thus may benefit from palliative care. Palliative care requires close collaboration among multiple health care providers, patients, and their families to share the diagnosis, prognosis, realistic treatment goals, and treatment decisions. Several approaches, such as conservative management, extracorporeal, and peritoneal palliative dialysis, can be attempted to globally meet the needs of patients with kidney disease (e.g., physical, social, psychological, or spiritual needs). Particularly for frail patients, pharmacologic management or peritoneal dialysis may be more appropriate than extracorporeal treatment. Extracorporeal dialysis treatment may be disproportionate in these patients and associated with a high burden of symptoms correlated with this invasive procedure. For those patients undergoing extracorporeal dialysis, individualized goal setting and a broader concept of adequacy should be considered as the foundations of extracorporeal palliative dialysis. Interestingly, little evidence is available on palliative and end of life care for acute kidney injury (AKI) patients. In this review, the main variables influencing medical decision-making about palliative care in patients with kidney disease are described, as well as the different approaches that can fulfill the needs of patients with CKD and AKI.","['acute kidney injury', 'chronic kidney disease', 'end of-life care', 'end-stage kidney disease', 'kidney replacement therapy', 'palliative care']",Journal of clinical medicine,2022-07-10,"[{'lastname': 'Lanini', 'firstname': 'Iacopo', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Section of Anesthesia, Intensive Care and Pain Medicine, University of Florence, 50121 Florence, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Samoni', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Dialysis, ASST Lariana, S.

28137936",Elabela Attenuates the TGF-β1-Induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Peritoneal Mesothelial Cells in Patients Receiving Peritoneal Dialysis.,"Peritoneal fibrosis (PF), a common complication in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD), is primarily caused by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs). PF is the main reason for patients on PD to withdraw from PD. Effective treatment is unavailable for this complication at present. Elabela (ELA) is a polypeptide hormone secreted by the vascular endothelium and kidney. Peptide hormones ELA and apelin (APLN) have various protective effects on the cardiovascular and urinary systems and have potential therapeutic effects on organ fibrosis. ELA and APLN are less studied in PD population. Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical significance of ELA in patients on PD and to evaluate the therapeutic effect of ELA on EMT of HPMCs. Compared with those in patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis, serum ELA levels in patients on PD increased with the improvement of residual renal function at PD duration <36 months and decreased to pre-dialysis levels at PD duration ≥36 months, suggesting that dialysis duration is the main risk factor affecting serum ELA levels in patients on PD. In addition, serum APLN levels decreased in the early stage of PD and recovered to the pre-dialysis level with the prolongation of dialysis time. Notably, serum APLN levels were positively correlated with dialysis duration in patients undergoing PD. To establish the EMT model, we stimulated HPMCs using transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) in cell experiments performed ","['EMT', 'HPMCs', 'TGF-beta/SMAD/ERK/AKT pathway', 'apelin', 'chronic kidney disease', 'elabela', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'peritoneal fibrosis']",Frontiers in pharmacology,2022-07-09,"[{'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Shunyun', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Feng', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Yue', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yixian', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xinyang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Mengyuan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cui', 'firstname': 'Wenpeng', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2022 Xie, Xu, Lu, Zhang, Li, Yu and Cui.","10.3389/fphar.2022.890881

30040605",Optimization of the Chronic Kidney Disease-Peritoneal Dialysis App to Improve Care for Patients on Peritoneal Dialysis in Northeast Thailand: User-Centered Design Study.,"The prevalence of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in Thailand is increasing rapidly in part because of Thailand's Peritoneal Dialysis First policy. PD is a home-based renal replacement therapy in which patients with chronic kidney disease perform up to 4 exchanges of dialysate fluid per day in the peritoneal cavity. Overhydration is one of the most common complications in patients on PD and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. To monitor hydration status, patients collect hydration metrics, including body weight, blood pressure, urine output, and ultrafiltration volume, from each dialysis cycle and enter this information into a PD logbook. This information is reviewed bimonthly at PD clinic appointments. The chronic kidney disease-PD (CKD-PD) app with near-field communication (NFC) and optical character recognition (OCR) was developed to automate hydration metric collection. The information was displayed in the app for self-monitoring and uploaded to a database for real-time monitoring by the PD clinic staff. Early detection and treatment of overhydration could potentially reduce the morbidity and mortality related to overhydration.
This study aims to identify usability issues and technology adoption barriers for the CKD-PD app with NFC and OCR and a monitoring system and to use this information to make rapid cycle improvements.
A multidisciplinary team of nephrologists, PD clinic nurses, computer programmers, and engineers trained and observed 2 groups of 5 participants in the use of the CKD-PD app with NFC and OCR and a monitoring system. The participants were observed using technology in their homes in 3 phases. The data collected included the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology questionnaire, think-aloud observation, user ratings, completion of hydration metrics, and upload of hydration metrics to the central database. These results were used by the team between phases to improve the functionality and usefulness of the app.
The CKD-PD app with NFC and OCR and a monitoring system underwent 3 rapid improvement cycles. Issues were identified regarding the usability of the NFC and OCR data collection, app stability, user interface, hydration metric calculation, and display. NFC and OCR improved hydration metric capture; however, issues remained with their usability. App stability and user interface issues were corrected, and hydration metrics were successfully uploaded by the end of phase 3. Participants' scores on technology adoption decreased but were still high, and there was enthusiasm for the self-monitoring and clinical communication features.
Our rapid cycle process improvement methodology identified and resolved key barriers and usability issues for the CKD-PD app with NFC and OCR and a monitoring system. We believe that this methodology can be accomplished with limited training in data collection, statistical analysis, and funding.","['UTAUT', 'Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology', 'barrier', 'computer program', 'dialysis', 'home monitoring', 'interface', 'internal medicine', 'kidney', 'mHealth', 'methodology', 'metric capture', 'mobile health', 'mobile phone', 'monitor', 'near-field communication', 'nephrologist', 'nephrology', 'peritoneal', 'peritoneum', 'process improvement', 'quality improvement', 'rapid cycle improvement', 'rapid cycle process improvement methodology', 'renal', 'usability']",JMIR formative research,2022-07-07,"[{'lastname': 'Lukkanalikitkul', 'firstname': 'Eakalak', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Center of Excellence in Kidney Diseases, Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Kongpetch', 'firstname': 'Sawinee', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center of Excellence in Kidney Diseases, Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chotmongkol', 'firstname': 'Wijittra', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Center of Excellence in Kidney Diseases, Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Morley', 'firstname': 'Michael G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Anutrakulchai', 'firstname': 'Sirirat', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Srichan', 'firstname': 'Chavis', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Thinkhamrop', 'firstname': 'Bandit', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Data Management and Statistical Analysis Center, Faculty of Public Health, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chunghom', 'firstname': 'Theenatchar', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Unit, Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Wiangnon', 'firstname': 'Pongsai', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Unit, Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Thinkhamrop', 'firstname': 'Wilaiphorn', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Data Management and Statistical Analysis Center, Faculty of Public Health, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Morley', 'firstname': 'Katharine E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Global Health, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.'}]",None,None,"The CKD-PD app with NFC and OCR and a monitoring system underwent 3 rapid improvement cycles.

28394760","Translation, cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the EPOCH-RRT questionnaire ""Empowering Patients On Choices For Renal Replacement Therapy"" for the Brazilian context.","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem. In Brazil, the incidence and prevalence rates of dialysis CKD progressively increase, but the transition process is a challenge for patients and caregivers in coping with the disease. Dialysis urgency, lack of planned access or prior knowledge of treatment is a reality for most. Guidelines recommend that treatment options should include the conscious preference of a fully informed patient. However, pre-dialysis educational information is an exception, leading to a large number of unplanned initial dialysis. The original study ""Empowering Patients on Choices for Renal Replacement Therapy"" (EPOCH-RRT) aimed to identify patient priorities and gaps in shared decision-making about dialysis, using structured interviews with questions about demographics, clinical history and patients' perception of their health. The goal of this study was to carry out the translation, cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the questionnaires used in the EPOCH-RRT Study for the Brazilian context.
This is a methodological study that consisted of the initial translation, synthesis of the translations, back translation, review by a committee of experts, pre-test and evaluation of the psychometric properties of the instrument. All ethical precepts were followed.
The questionnaires were translated, adapted and validated for the Brazilian context. Additionally, it was applied to 84 chronic renal patients on hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and outpatients.
There is a lack of an educational-therapeutic approach aimed at patients with CKD, and the EPOCH-RRT questionnaire can be a tool for Brazilian dialysis services to change this paradigm.
A doença renal crônica (DRC) é um problema de saúde pública mundial. No Brasil, as taxas de incidência e prevalência da DRC dialítica aumentam progressivamente, mas o processo de transição apresenta-se como desafio para pacientes e cuidadores no enfrentamento da doença. Urgência dialítica, ausência de acesso planejado ou conhecimento prévio do tratamento é uma realidade para a maioria. Diretrizes recomendam que opções de tratamento devam incluir a preferência consciente de um paciente totalmente informado. No entanto, informação educacional pré-diálise é exceção, acarretando grande número de diálises iniciais não planejadas. O estudo original “Empowering Patients on Choices for Renal Replacement Therapy” (EPOCH-RRT) teve por objetivo identificar as prioridades do paciente e as lacunas na tomada de decisões compartilhadas sobre a diálise, utilizando entrevistas estruturadas, com questões sobre dados demográficos, história clínica e percepção dos pacientes sobre sua saúde. O objetivo desta pesquisa foi realizar a tradução, adaptação transcultural e validação dos questionários utilizados no Estudo EPOCH-RRT para o contexto brasileiro.
Trata-se de estudo metodológico que consistiu na tradução inicial, síntese das traduções, retro tradução, revisão por um comitê de especialistas, pré-teste e avaliação das propriedades psicométricas do instrumento. Todos os preceitos éticos foram seguidos.
Os questionários foram traduzidos, adaptados e validados para o contexto brasileiro. Adicionalmente, foi aplicado em 84 pacientes renais crônicos em hemodiálise, diálise peritoneal e ambulatoriais.

30642656",Infectious and mechanical complications in planned-start vs. urgent-start peritoneal dialysis: a cohort study.,"Few studies have compared the infectious and mechanical complications seen in planned-start and urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
To compare the incidence and etiology of mechanical and infectious complications in patients offered planned- and urgent-start PD and assess potential differences in patient survival and time on PD.
This retrospective cohort study included patients with chronic kidney disease on planned- and urgent-start PD seen from 2014 to 2020 and compared them for mechanical and infectious complications, clinical outcome, death rates, and need to switch to hemodialysis.
Ninety-nine patients on planned-start PD and 206 on urgent-start PD were included. Incidence of exit-site infection (18.9 vs. 17.17%, p=0.71) and peritonitis (24.27 vs. 27.27%, p=0.57) were similar between patients, while pathogens causing peritonitis were different, although non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli were more commonly seen in the planned-start PD group. Leakage as a mechanical complication and hospitalization were more common among patients needing urgent-start PD (10.68 vs. 2.02%, p=0.0085 and 35.44 vs. 17.17%, p=0.0011, respectively). Patient survival was similar between groups. Cox regression found an association between death and age (HR=1.051, 95% CI 1.026-1.07, p=0.0001) and albumin (HR=0.66, 95% CI 0.501-0.893, p=0.0064), and between peritonitis and a diagnosis of diabetes (HR=2.016, 95% CI 1.25-3.25, p=0.004).
Patient survival and time on PD were similar between the planned- and urgent-start PD groups, while leakage was more frequently seen in the urgent-start PD group. Death was associated with lower albumin levels and older age, while peritonitis was associated with diabetes.

33593237",Enhanced Oxidative DNA-Damage in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients via the TXNIP/TRX Axis.,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an effective method of renal replacement therapy, providing a high level of patient autonomy. Nevertheless, the long-term use of PD is limited due to deleterious effects of PD fluids to the structure and function of the peritoneal membrane leading to loss of dialysis efficacy. PD patients show excessive oxidative stress compared to controls or chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients not on dialysis. Therefore, defense systems against detrimental events play a pivotal role in the integrity of the peritoneal membrane. The thioredoxin-interacting-protein (TXNIP)/thioredoxin (TRX) system also plays a major role in maintaining the redox homeostasis. We hypothesized that the upregulation of TXNIP negatively influences TRX activity, resulting in enhanced oxidative DNA-damage in PD patients. Therefore, we collected plasma samples and human peritoneal biopsies of healthy controls and PD patients as well. Using ELISA-analysis and immunohistochemistry, we showed that PD patients had elevated TXNIP levels compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PD patients had a reduced TRX activity, thereby leading to increased oxidative DNA-damage. Hence, targeting the TXNIP/TRX system as well as the use of oxidative stress scavengers could become promising therapeutic approaches potentially applicable in clinical practice in order to sustain and improve peritoneal membrane function.","['oxidative damage', 'oxidative stress', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'thioredoxin', 'thioredoxin-interacting-protein']","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022-06-25,"[{'lastname': 'Oberacker', 'firstname': 'Tina', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and University of Tuebingen, Auerbachstr. 112, 70376 Stuttgart, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Fritz', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine and Nephrology, Robert-Bosch-Hospital, Auerbachstr. 110, 70376 Stuttgart, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schanz', 'firstname': 'Moritz', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine and Nephrology, Robert-Bosch-Hospital, Auerbachstr. 110, 70376 Stuttgart, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Alscher', 'firstname': 'Mark Dominik', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine and Nephrology, Robert-Bosch-Hospital, Auerbachstr. 110, 70376 Stuttgart, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ketteler', 'firstname': 'Markus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine and Nephrology, Robert-Bosch-Hospital, Auerbachstr. 110, 70376 Stuttgart, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schricker', 'firstname': 'Severin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine and Nephrology, Robert-Bosch-Hospital, Auerbachstr. 110, 70376 Stuttgart, Germany.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/antiox11061124

172,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35735342,[Health-related quality of life of patients on peritoneal dialysis].,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important predictor of health outcomes in chronic kidney disease (CKD) including those patients in renal replacement therapy. Its evaluation through validated questionnaires is essential for comprehensive care in people undergoing renal replacement therapy.
To evaluate the quality of life in patients with CKD on peritoneal dialysis.
Descriptive cross-sectional study. The KDQOL-36 quality of life questionnaire was applied to 67 patients aged 55 ± 15 years, in peritoneal dialysis at a public hospital in Santiago. Scores range from 0 to 100, values greater than 50 represent a better HRQoL.
The burden, symptoms, and effects of kidney disease component of the survey had scores over 50. Women, people without diabetes, those actively working and those with better incomes reported a better HRQoL.

173,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35725048,An overview of pediatric peritoneal dialysis and renal replacement therapy in infants: A review for the general pediatric surgeon.,"Currently, there are about 10,000 pediatric patients in the United States who rely on dialysis for renal replacement therapy. Dialysis allows children with chronic kidney disease a means of support until renal transplant is feasible. All forms of renal replacement therapy require a surgical intervention, whether the modality is hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Despite peritoneal dialysis being the most common modality of dialysis in children, there is not prospectively collected much evidence in the literature which can guide the pediatric surgeon about best practices on access placement, management of complications, and timing of removal. Most available studies are small, single-center retrospective reviews. This limits the power of the data collected to help guide decision-making in the management of peritoneal dialysis catheters. The purpose of this review is to provide a consolidated source of best available evidence and identify important areas for future study. Furthermore, this is an area of pediatric surgical care that lacks up to date outcomes research with robust surgeon participation. Lack of coordinated, evidence-based best practices likely results in heterogenous surgical practices and uneven strategies for managing complications. Furthermore, with improvements in neonatal critical care and fetal interventions available for obstructive uropathies and other congenital kidney disorders, there is increased likelihood of the need for dialysis access in more infants, who represent a particularly vulnerable patient population. Importantly, peritoneal dialysis access should be instituted into the national PEDScore curriculum for pediatric surgical fellows, as this procedure is common enough that any pediatric surgeon could be consulted for catheter placement and management. Surgeon awareness of, and participation in the formulation, of guidelines and prospective studies is of paramount importance to ensure optimal care of this vulnerable population of children.",[],Seminars in pediatric surgery,2022-06-21,"[{'lastname': 'Rasmussen', 'firstname': 'Sara K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': ""Seattle Children's Hospital/University of Washington Department of Surgery, 4800 Sand Point Way NE Seattle, WA 98105, United States.

28264439",The relationship between the prognostic nutritional index and new-onset pneumonia in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"As an indicator of nutrition and immunity, the prognostic value of the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) has been confirmed in various diseases. However, the relationship between PNI and the incidence of pneumonia in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between PNI and new-onset pneumonia in patients undergoing PD.
Thousand two hundred and nighty eight patients were enrolled in this multicenter retrospective study from February 1, 2010, to February 28, 2020. A total of 899 patients were included in the final statistical analysis. The patients were stratified into two groups by PNI quartiles. The primary endpoint was a new-onset pneumonia event. Cox regression model analysis was used to explore the association between PNI and the first occurrence of pneumonia.
During a mean follow-up of 41.43 months, 147 patients developed new-onset pneumonia. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a significant difference in the incidence of the first presentation of pneumonia between the two groups, that patients in the low PNI group had a higher risk of pneumonia (P = 0.016). By adjusting for demographic parameters, comorbidities, and laboratory indicators, the Cox regression model showed that the high PNI group had less risk compared to the low PNI group (HR 0.479 95% CI 0.297-0.772, P = 0.003). There were no interactions in the subgroups as follows: diabetes, hypertension, age, and sex.
Low PNI levels were independently associated with the first occurrence of pneumonia in PD patients. PNI was an independent predictor of new-onset pneumonia in PD patients.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Pneumonia', 'Prognostic nutrition index']",International urology and nephrology,2022-06-15,"[{'lastname': 'Shang', 'firstname': 'Sijia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Yajuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhan', 'firstname': 'Xiaojiang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University, Nanchang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Peng', 'firstname': 'Fenfen', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Xiaoyang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wen', 'firstname': 'Yueqiang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Xiaoran', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Jiujiang No. 1 People's Hospital, Jiujiang, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Qian', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Statistics, Clinical Trials Unit, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Li-Wen', 'initials': 'LW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Affiliated Tung Wah Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Dongguan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Long', 'firstname': 'Haibo', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Yuanyuan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Qinqin', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Xingyu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Xingming', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Affiliated Tung Wah Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Dongguan, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Su', 'firstname': 'Ning', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China.

14963588",Impact of different automated peritoneal dialysis modalities on the inflammatory profile of elderly patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease, more prevalent in the elderly, is considered a public health issue worldwide.
To evaluate the impact of automated, peritoneal dialysis modalities, intermittent and continuous, on the inflammatory profile of elderly people with chronic kidney disease.
Prospective, cross-sectional and analytical study carried out in a dialysis clinic in Brasília - Brazil, with 74 elderly people aged 60 years or older. The patients underwent rapid Peritoneal Equilibration Test, clinical assessment, blood collection for biochemical and cytokine assessments, interleukin 6 and transforming growth factor beta 1, and answered a quality-of-life questionnaire (KDQOL-SF36). We used a 5% significance level for data analysis, associations and correlations.
Patients in the continuous modality had higher serum values of transforming growth factor beta 1 than those in the intermittent modality, which had higher peritoneal transforming growth factor beta 1, age and residual renal function than those in continuous mode. Interleukin 6 dosage in the peritoneum was associated with age, while serum IL-6 was associated with IL-6 in the peritoneum, time on dialysis and age. There was no association between the modality and the presence of diabetes, blood volume or nutritional status. Both modalities enable good adaptation to the dialysis treatment.
Inflammation in automated peritoneal dialysis is mainly associated with low residual renal function, advanced age and longer time on therapy, and not to the type of dialysis performed.

Estudo prospectivo, transversal e analítico realizado em uma clínica de diálise em Brasília, com 74 idosos com idade igual ou maior que 60 anos. Os pacientes foram submetidos ao Teste de Equilíbrio Peritoneal rápido, avaliação clínica, coleta de sangue para avaliações bioquímicas e de citocinas, interleucina 6 e fator de crescimento transformador beta 1, e questionário de qualidade de vida (KDQOL-SF36). Foram utilizadas para análise dos dados, associações e correlações com nível de significância de 5%.
Pacientes na modalidade contínua apresentaram valores séricos do fator de crescimento transformador beta 1 maiores do que os em modalidade intermitente. Estes apresentaram fator de crescimento transformador beta 1 no peritônio, idade e função renal residual maiores do que os em modalidade contínua. A dosagem da interleucina 6 no peritônio foi associada à idade, enquanto a IL-6 sérica foi associada à IL-6 no peritônio, ao tempo em diálise e à idade. Não houve associação entre a modalidade e a presença de diabetes, volemia ou estado nutricional. Ambas as modalidades permitem boa adequação à terapia dialítica.

This study aimed to quantify adipose and serum ZAG expression and evaluate their association with body composition and its longitudinal change, together with mortality in incident dialysis patients. We performed a single-center prospective cohort study. Patients who were planned for peritoneal dialysis were recruited. ZAG levels were measured from serum sample, subcutaneous and pre-peritoneal fat tissue obtained during peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion. Body composition and functional state were evaluated by bioimpedance spectroscopy and Clinical Frailty Scale respectively at baseline and were repeated 1 year later. Primary outcome was 2-year survival. Secondary outcomes were longitudinal changes of body composition. At baseline, the average adipose and serum ZAG expression was 13.4 ± 130.0-fold and 74.7 ± 20.9 µg/ml respectively. Both adipose and serum ZAG expressions independently predicted adipose tissue mass (ATM) (p = 0.001, p = 0.008, respectively). At 1 year, ATM increased by 3.3 ± 7.4 kg (p < 0.001) while lean tissue mass (LTM) remained similar (p = 0.5). Adipose but not serum ZAG level predicted change in ATM (p = 0.007) and LTM (p = 0.01).

8254858",Developing and validating a prognostic prediction model for patients with chronic kidney disease stages 3-5 based on disease conditions and intervention methods: a retrospective cohort study in China.,"To develop and validate a nomogram model to predict chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3-5 prognosis.
A retrospective cohort study. We used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis to select the relevant predictors. To select the best model, we evaluated the prediction models' accuracy by concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). We evaluated the clinical utility by decision curve analysis.
Chronic Disease Management (CDM) Clinic in the Nephrology Department at the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine.
Patients with CKD stages 3-5 in the derivation and validation cohorts were 459 and 326, respectively.
Renal replacement therapy (haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, renal transplantation) or death.
We built four models. Age, estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine protein constituted the most basic model A. Haemoglobin, serum uric acid, cardiovascular disease, primary disease, CDM adherence and predictors in model A constituted model B. Oral medications and predictors in model A constituted model C. All the predictors constituted model D. Model B performed well in both discrimination and calibration (C-index: derivation cohort: 0.881, validation cohort: 0.886). Compared with model A, model B showed significant improvement in the net reclassification and integrated discrimination (model A vs model B: NRI: 1 year: 0.339 (-0.011 to 0.672) and 2 years: 0.314 (0.079 to 0.574); IDI: 1 year: 0.066 (0.010 to 0.127), p<0.001 and 2 years: 0.063 (0.008 to 0.106), p<0.001). There was no significant improvement between NRI and IDI among models B, C and D. Therefore, we selected model B as the optimal model.
We constructed a prediction model to predict the prognosis of patients with CKD stages 3-5 in the first and second year. Applying this model to clinical practice may guide clinical decision-making. Also, this model needs to be externally validated in the future.

180,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35609860,Tuberculosis incidence in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The aim of this study was to estimate global TB incidence in patients with CKD.
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method was followed to perform the study. Electronic and gray literature sources were investigated for studies published between 2000 and 2021. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist was used to assess the quality of the studies, and STATA version 16 was used for analysis. The I
A total of 104 studies with a sample size of 1,548,774 were included. TB incidence in patients with CKD ranges from 60 per 100,000 in the UK to 19,270 per 100,000 in China. The pooled TB incidence was estimated as 3718 per 100,000 (95%CI; 3024, 4411). Higher pooled TB incidence was found in the African region (9952/100,000, 95%CI; 6854, 13,051), followed by the South-East Asian (7200/100,000, 95%CI; 4537, 9863) and Eastern Mediterranean (5508/100,000, 95%CI; 3470, 7547) regions. In particular, patients on hemodialysis (5611/100,000) and on peritoneal dialysis (3533/100,000) had higher incidence of TB than did renal transplantation patients (2700/100,000) and patients with predialysis CKD (913/100,000). Furthermore, extrapulmonary TB (2227/100,000) was more common than pulmonary TB (1786/100,000).
This study identifies high TB incidence in patients with CKD with regional disparities.

31641778",Role of Cinacalcet in Treating Cardiac Dysfunction Secondary to Hyperparathyroidism: A Case Series.,"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). A strong correlation exists between disturbed calcium-phosphate metabolism and cardiac dysfunction. Studies with use of cinacalcet in CKD are few and limited to older children and adults and in improving growth and bone deformities. We present three children with CKD on CAPD with cardiac dysfunction with refractory hyperparathyroidism. Patients were initiated on lowest adult weight-adjusted dose of 0.2 mg/kg/day.

34276974",The Symptom Monitoring with Feedback Trial (SWIFT): protocol for a registry-based cluster randomised controlled trial in haemodialysis.,"Kidney failure prevalence is increasing worldwide. Haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or kidney transplantation are undertaken to extend life with kidney failure. People receiving haemodialysis commonly experience fatigue, pain, nausea, cramping, itching, sleeping difficulties, anxiety and depression. This symptom burden contributes to poor health-related quality of life (QOL) and is a major reason for treatment withdrawal and death. The Symptom monitoring WIth Feedback Trial (SWIFT) will test the hypothesis that regular symptom monitoring with feedback to people receiving haemodialysis and their treating clinical team can improve QOL.
We are conducting an Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant (ANZDATA) registry-based cluster randomised controlled trial to determine the clinical- and cost-effectiveness at 12 months, of 3-monthly symptom monitoring using the Integrated Palliative Outcome Scale-Renal (IPOS-Renal) survey with clinician feedback, compared with usual care among adults treated with haemodialysis. Participants complete symptom scoring using a tablet, which are provided to participants and to clinicians. The trial aims to recruit 143 satellite haemodialysis centres, (up to 2400 participants). The primary outcome is change in health-related QOL, as measured by EuroQol 5-Dimension, 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) instrument. Secondary outcomes include overall survival, symptom severity (including haemodialysis-associated fatigue), healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness.
SWIFT is the first registry-based trial in the Australian haemodialysis population to investigate whether regular symptom monitoring with feedback to participants and clinicians improves QOL. SWIFT is embedded in the ANZDATA Registry facilitating pragmatic recruitment from public and private dialysis clinics, throughout Australia. SWIFT will inform future collection, storage and reporting of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) within a clinical quality registry. As the first trial to rigorously estimate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of routine PROMs collection and reporting in haemodialysis units, SWIFT will provide invaluable information to health services, clinicians and researchers working to improve the lives of those with kidney failure.

We examined the gut microbiota of a healthy Taiwanese population, identified various bacterial drivers in different demographics, and compared them with dialysis patients to associate kidney disease progression with changes in gut microbiota.
This was a cross-sectional cohort study.
Fecal samples were obtained from 119 healthy Taiwanese volunteers, and 16S rRNA sequencing was done on the V3-V4 regions to identify the bacterial enterotypes. Twenty-six samples from the above cohort were compared with fecal samples from 22 peritoneal dialysis and 16 hemodialysis patients to identify species-level bacterial biomarkers in the dysbiotic gut of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
Specific bacterial species were identified pertaining to different demographics such as gender, age, BMI, physical activity, and sleeping habits. Dialysis patients had a significant difference in gut microbiome composition compared to healthy controls. The most abundant genus identified in CKD patients was

185,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35532699,Insulin resistance in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease patients.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is accompanied by numerous metabolic derangements due to risk factors such as oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Insulin resistance (IR) has been reported as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. As reported from previous studies, it has been shown that IR is also seen in mild-to-moderate stages of CKD. Hence, the present study aimed to study IR in nondiabetic CKD patients and correlated with different stages of CKD. A two-year cross-sectional study was conducted in 175 patients among whom 25 healthy controls and 150 nondiabetic CKD patients in different stages are included. In the present study, fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR) levels were found to be higher in all nondiabetic CKD patients when compared to controls which was found to be statistically significant (P <0.05). In the present study, IR, as evidenced by HOMA-IR, is noted in patients on predialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and postrenal transplant patients. Hence, periodic monitoring of IR by HOMA-IR might be prudent in CKD patients on predialysis, CAPD and in postrenal transplant patients. Interventions targeting IR in this patient population can also decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",[],"Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2022-05-10,"[{'lastname': 'Nallamothu', 'firstname': 'Praveen', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Nimmanapalli', 'firstname': 'Harini Devi', 'initials': 'HD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sachan', 'firstname': 'Alok', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Endocrinology, Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Srinivasa Rao', 'firstname': 'P Vln', 'initials': 'PV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Vishnubotla', 'firstname': 'Sivakumar', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh, India.'}]",None,None,None,None,10.4103/1319-2442.344749,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17ef1a4d0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,35532699,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35532699,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan
186,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35532690,Beta 2 microglobulin in kidney failure: A review and an algorithm for renal replacement therapy.,"For decades, beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) has been a subject of great interest in nephrology and other fields such as multiple myeloma. B2M, a 99 amino acid protein, is associated with amyloid deposits in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT). The source of information is published articles on B2M in chronic renal failure since 1960. We have reviewed literature published since 1960 to date, highlighting the milestones of the role of B2M in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and B2M serum values in patients treated by various RRTs. B2M deposits associated with the disease include carpal tunnel syndrome, spondyloarthropathy, and arthritis of large joints such as the shoulders. The role of RRT in the removal of B2M in CKD is discussed. Recent reports include factors affecting the process of fibrillation and deposition of B2M in tissues. A comparative report of various modalities of treatment on the serum levels of B2M is provided. The presence of significant residual urine output in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients may explain why peritoneal dialysis is a modality that is associated with the lowest level of serum B2M. Patients treated with hemodiafiltration or hemodialysis (HD) using high flux dialyzers have lower levels of B2M than those treated by HD with low flux dialyzers. Finally, based on the literature review, an algorithm for RRT using B2M level monitoring and other variables is proposed and needs evaluation in a controlled trial.",[],"Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2022-05-10,"[{'lastname': 'Assounga', 'firstname': 'Alain G', 'initials': 'AG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Division of Medicine, Nelson R.

28421638",Incremental Hemodialysis: What We Know so Far.,"Traditionally, patients that develop progressive chronic kidney disease in need of kidney replacement therapy are prescribed thrice weekly in-center hemodialysis sessions at the beginning of therapy. This empiric prescription is based on historic trials that were comprised of mostly prevalent patients. Incremental hemodialysis is the process of performing <3 sessions of dialysis per week or limiting dialysis dose by duration at the initial onset of treatment to provide a more gradual transition, mimicking the progressive nature of kidney disease. Adding clearance contributions from residual kidney function is the standard of care with peritoneal dialysis but has not routinely been employed with hemodialysis. Accounting for residual kidney function accompanied by improvement in adjuvant pharmacotherapy, such as newer potassium binding agents and dietary modification, can augment dialytic clearances and allow for an incremental approach. Utilizing incremental dialysis has been associated with both preserving residual kidney function as well as improving patient quality of life. Barriers to this approach include concerns regarding patient acceptance of dialysis prescription changes, adherence to therapy, and provider factors that would require a restructuring of the current thrice weekly hemodialysis rubric. Candidacy for incremental therapy has shown the best outcomes when urea clearances exceed 3 mL/min and urine volumes are >500 mL/day, although these measures have been deemed conservative. A significant amount of retrospective and registry data has been supportive of initiating incremental hemodialysis and several pilot studies have shown the feasibility of implementing such an approach. Larger, randomized control trials are needed to fully evaluate safety and efficacy to allow for more widespread acceptance of this patient-centered approach to chronic kidney disease.","['hemodialysis', 'incremental dialysis', 'twice-weekly']",International journal of nephrology and renovascular disease,2022-05-07,"[{'lastname': 'Soi', 'firstname': 'Vivek', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA.\nWayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Faber', 'firstname': 'Mark D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA.\nWayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Paul', 'firstname': 'Ritika', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI, USA.'}]",None,None,None,© 2022 Soi et al.,"10.2147/IJNRD.S286947

Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Adult patients with CKD not receiving kidney replacement therapy (KRT), as well as adults receiving KRT, including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation.
A systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and PsycNET, was conducted for articles published between January 1, 1990, and September 28, 2018.
Data on the prevalences of poor sleep quality and insomnia in patients with CKD, including those receiving and not receiving KRT, were extracted.
Pooled prevalences were estimated using a random-effects meta-analysis and were stratified according to age, CKD stage, World Health Organization region, risk of bias, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score, and the different criteria for insomnia that were used at diagnosis.
Of 3,708 articles, 93 were selected, and significant methodological heterogeneity was present. The pooled prevalences of poor sleep quality for CKD without KRT, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation were 59% (95% CI, 44%-73%), 68% (95% CI, 64%-73%), 67% (95% CI, 44%-86%), and 46% (95% CI, 34%-59%), respectively. The corresponding prevalences of insomnia were 48% (95% CI, 30%-67%), 46% (95% CI, 39%-54%), 61% (95% CI, 41%-79%), and 26% (95% CI, 9%-49%), respectively. Insomnia was significantly more prevalent among patients aged 51-60 years and those aged >60 years than among those aged <50 years. The prevalence of insomnia in the European region was the lowest of all World Health Organization regions.
High interstudy heterogeneity.
Approximately half of the patients with advanced CKD had poor sleep quality or insomnia, and the prevalence was even higher among those who received KRT. Kidney transplantation may reduce the burden of poor sleep quality and insomnia.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'hemodialysis', 'insomnia', 'kidney transplantation', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'poor sleep quality']",Kidney medicine,2022-05-07,"[{'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Lek-Hong', 'initials': 'LH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Pei-Shan', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': 'Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chiang', 'firstname': 'Hsiu-Yin', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': 'Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'King', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Media Design and Application, Saint Bear Incorporated, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yeh', 'firstname': 'Hung-Chieh', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.\nDivision of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hsiao', 'firstname': 'Ya-Luan', 'initials': 'YL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'David Ray', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.\nDivision of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Sheng-Hsuan', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Min-Yen', 'initials': 'MY', 'affiliation': 'Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuo', 'firstname': 'Chin-Chi', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Big Data Center, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.\nDivision of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, China Medical University Hospital and College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}]",None,None,"Of 3,708 articles, 93 were selected, and significant methodological heterogeneity was present.

33228017",How peritoneal dialysis transforms the peritoneum and vasculature in children with chronic kidney disease-what can we learn for future treatment?,"Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffer from inflammation and reactive metabolite-induced stress, which massively accelerates tissue and vascular aging. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the preferred dialysis mode in children, but currently used PD fluids contain far supraphysiological glucose concentrations for fluid and toxin removal and glucose degradation products (GDP). While the peritoneal membrane of children with CKD G5 exhibits only minor alterations, PD fluids trigger numerous molecular cascades resulting in major peritoneal membrane inflammation, hypervascularization, and fibrosis, with distinct molecular and morphological patterns depending on the GDP content of the PD fluid used. PD further aggravates systemic vascular disease. The systemic vascular aging process is particularly pronounced when PD fluids with high GDP concentrations are used. GDP induce endothelial junction disintegration, apoptosis, fibrosis, and intima thickening. This review gives an overview on the molecular mechanisms of peritoneal and vascular transformation and strategies to improve peritoneal and vascular health in patients on PD.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Endothelial', 'Glucose degradation products', 'Mesothelial', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Peritoneal membrane', 'Vascular disease']",Molecular and cellular pediatrics,2022-05-06,"[{'lastname': 'Bartosova', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zarogiannis', 'firstname': 'Sotirios G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.\nDepartment of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmitt', 'firstname': 'Claus Peter', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. clauspeter.schmitt@med.uni-heidelberg.de.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,© 2022.

33925259",Cost of illness of chronic kidney disease in Lebanon: from the societal and third-party payer perspectives.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the 12
This is a cross-sectional study of CKD patients who presented to two nephrology clinics during November 2020. Their medical and administrative records were reviewed for collection of demographics, CKD characteristics, direct medical costs (medications, diagnostic tests, hospitalizations, inpatient care, outpatient care), direct non-medical costs (transportation) and indirect costs (productivity losses) for one year. Kruskal Wallis test was used to compare the costs between different CKD stages and categories. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate risk factors associated with costs.
The sample included 102 non-dialysis CKD patients, 40 hemodialysis, 8 peritoneal dialysis and 10 transplant patients. Their mean age was 66.74 ± 15.36 years, 57.5% were males and 42.5% diabetics. The total median cost per year of CKD across all categories was assessed to be 7,217,500 Lebanese Pounds (3,750,000-35,535,250; 1 $USD = 1515 LBP in 2019) from the societal perspective and 5,685,500 LBP (2,281,750- 32,386,500) from the third-party payer perspective. Statistical analysis showed a higher total cost in hemodialysis (p < 0.001), higher cost of medications in transplant (p < 0.001) and higher cost in technique modality in peritoneal dialysis (p < 0.001). In a sub-analysis of hemodialysis patients, dialysis vintage negatively correlated with total societal cost (r = -0.391, p = 0.013); the regression analysis found diabetes as a risk factor for higher cost (OR = 2.3; 95%CI: 0.638,8.538; p = 0.201). In the subcategory of CKD-ND patients, age correlated with total societal cost (r = 0.323, p = 0.001); diabetes and coronary artery disease were significantly associated with higher total cost (OR = 2.4; 95%CI: 1.083,5.396; p = 0.031; OR = 3.7; 95%CI: 1.535,8.938; p = 0.004).
This cost of illness study showed a high burden of hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis cost compared to transplant and non-dialysis CKD patients. It revealed a significantly higher cost of medications in transplant patients. Health policies should target interventions that prevent end-stage kidney disease and encourage kidney transplantation.","['Burden of illness', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Cost-of-illness', 'Health costs', 'Hemodialysis', 'Kidney transplantation', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Pharmacoeconomics', 'Societal perspective']",BMC health services research,2022-05-04,"[{'lastname': 'Aoun', 'firstname': 'Mabel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Saint-Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon. aounmabel@yahoo.fr.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Saint-George Hospital, Ajaltoun, Lebanon. aounmabel@yahoo.fr.'}, {'lastname': 'Helou', 'firstname': 'Elie', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Faculty of Medicine, Saint-Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.'}, {'lastname': 'Sleilaty', 'firstname': 'Ghassan', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Unit of biostatistics, Faculty of Medicine, Saint-Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.'}, {'lastname': 'Zeenny', 'firstname': 'Rony M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacy Director, American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon.'}, {'lastname': 'Chelala', 'firstname': 'Dania', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Saint-Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.\nDepartment of Nephrology at Hotel-Dieu de France Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Saint-Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.'}]",None,None,"The sample included 102 non-dialysis CKD patients, 40 hemodialysis, 8 peritoneal dialysis and 10 transplant patients.

Data were obtained from the Japanese nationwide cross-sectional CKD stage 5 survey on pediatric patients (<20 years of age) who started KRT from 2006 to 2013. The cohort was divided into three groups according to age at the start of KRT: <1, 1-5, and 6-19 years.
Among the 701 children who were included, 59.3% were boys. Peritoneal dialysis was the most common initial modality of KRT (60.3%). Median age at KRT initiation was 10.2 years. Infants (<1 year old) accounted for 16.0% of the total cohort. Overall survival at 1 and 5 years was 97.2% and 92.5%, respectively. Infants had significantly lower survival rates than the other groups (hazard ratio, 5.35; 95% CI, 2.60-11.03; P < 0.001). In contrast, after the age of 1 year, the survival rate improved and did not differ from that of other age groups. The most common causes of death were infection (35.9%) and sudden death (15.4%).
The overall survival rate of pediatric patients with CKD stage 5 in Japan is like that in other high-income countries. Age at initiation of KRT is an important factor affecting survival since the poorest survival rate was observed in infants. Further improvement in infant dialysis therapy is still needed to improve survival of the youngest children.

194,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35483325,Paediatric Dialysis at a Tertiary Hospital in South-West Nigeria: A 4-Year Report.,"Dialysis is potentially lifesaving in children with acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), but availability is limited in low-income countries and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs).
In the present study, we perform a 4-year study of patients who received peritoneal dialysis (PD) or haemodialysis (HD) at the Paediatric Nephrology Unit of the University College Hospital Ibadan, Nigeria. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with sepsis or malaria AKI who underwent HD or PD for predictors of in-hospital mortality.
A total of 167 children aged 7 days to 18 years, median 7 (interquartile range 3-12) years, (60.5% males) were studied. In total, 129 (77.2%) had AKI, while 38 had CKD. Regarding AKI, 83 children (64.3%) received HD only, 42 underwent PD only, while 4 underwent both HD and PD. Malaria AKI was treated with HD in 43 (51.8%) or PD in 8 (10.5%), while sepsis AKI was treated with HD in 20 (21.4%) or PD in 33 (78.6%). Mortality in AKI was 16.3% overall, 10.8% in children on HD only, and 26.2% in children on PD only. Patients with sepsis AKI had higher mortality compared to patients with malaria AKI (RR 7.96 [1.70-37.37]). Subgroup analysis showed that age, diagnosis, and dialysis modality were not independent risk factors for mortality. The aetiology of CKD was glomerulonephritis in 26 (68.4%): treatment was HD in 36 and PD in 2 with mortality being 26.3%.
PD for AKI showed relatively good outcomes in a LMIC. However, funding and support for a formal dialysis program for the management of AKI and CKD are needed.","['Global health', 'Haemodialysis', 'Low-income countries and lower-middle-income countries', 'Paediatric nephrology', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Sub-Saharan Africa']",Blood purification,2022-04-29,"[{'lastname': 'Ademola', 'firstname': 'Adebowale D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.\nDepartment of Paediatrics, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Asinobi', 'firstname': 'Adanze O', 'initials': 'AO', 'affiliation': 'Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Clinical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.\nDepartment of Paediatrics, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Alao', 'firstname': 'Michael A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Paediatrics, University College Hospital, Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Wade', 'firstname': 'Andrew W', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': ""Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, Alberta Children's Hospital, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.""}]",None,None,"A total of 167 children aged 7 days to 18 years, median 7 (interquartile range 3-12) years, (60.5% males) were studied.

26919914",Physical activity and exercise recommendations for people receiving dialysis: A scoping review.,"Remaining physically active is important to patients undertaking dialysis, however, clinical recommendations regarding exercise type, timing, intensity, and safety precautions vary. The purpose of this scoping review was to analyse and summarise recommendations for physical activity and exercise for people undertaking dialysis and identify areas that require further research or clarification.
A scoping review of literature from five bibliographic databases (Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus) was conducted. Eligible articles included consensus guidelines, position statements, reviews, or clinical practice guidelines that included specific physical activity and exercise recommendations for people undertaking dialysis. Key search terms included ""kidney disease"" OR ""kidney failure"" OR ""chronic kidney disease"" OR ""end stage kidney disease"" AND guideline* OR consensus OR ""position statement"" OR prescription OR statement AND exercise OR ""physical activity"". Hand searching for relevant articles in all first twenty quartile 1 journals listed on SCImago under 'medicine-nephrology' and 'physical therapy, sports therapy and rehabilitation' using the terms 'exercise and dialysis' was undertaken. Finally, home pages of key societies and professional organisations in the field of sports medicine and nephrology were searched.
The systematic search strategy identified 19 articles met the inclusion criteria. Two were specific to pediatric dialysis and three to peritoneal dialysis. Whilst many publications provided recommendations on aerobic exercise, progressive resistance training and flexibility, few provided explicit guidance. Recommendations for the intensity, duration and frequency of aerobic and resistance training varied. Discrepancies or gaps in guidance about precautions, contraindications, termination criteria, progression, and access site precautions were also apparent.
Future guidelines should include specific guidance regarding physical activity, safety precautions, and timing and intensity of exercise for individuals who undertake dialysis.

19556299",Long-term outcomes of peritoneal dialysis catheters inserted by laparoscopic and percutaneous techniques in a single regional dialysis centre.,"Minimally invasive insertion of catheters for peritoneal dialysis can be performed laparoscopically or percutaneously under image guidance. In Geelong (Victoria, Australia) both methods are used. Our aim was to analyse the outcomes of all catheters inserted by both laparoscopic and percutaneous techniques and compare them against published studies from tertiary referral centres.
Data were collected retrospectively on all patients who had their catheter inserted (since 2006) within the Geelong regional service. We compared the outcomes of percutaneous catheter insertion under image guidance (percutaneous group, n = 29) with the laparoscopic catheter placement technique (laparoscopic group, n = 61). Perioperative, follow-up and catheter outcome data were collected. There were no exclusion criteria. Analysis was performed using the unpaired student t-test and chi-squared test.
Ninety catheters were inserted between 2006 and 2017 in mostly male patients (63%) with a mean age of 60 ± 0.4 years. The most common aetiology of chronic kidney disease was diabetic nephropathy (34%). Percutaneous insertion required less operative time, shorter hospital stay and earlier initiation of peritoneal dialysis. In the longer term, percutaneous catheters were more likely to migrate and laparoscopic catheters were more durable but more often associated with peritonitis. Thirty-day complication rates did not differ between both groups. No Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or 4 complication was reported.
Laparoscopic insertion of peritoneal dialysis catheters at our centre is performed safely and with patient outcomes comparable to published literature. Percutaneous insertion represents a safe and effective alternative based on the study findings.","['laparoscopic insertion', 'percutaneous insertion', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'tenckhoff catheter']",ANZ journal of surgery,2022-04-29,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Wai Gin', 'initials': 'WG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urological Surgery, Barwon Health, University Hospital Geelong, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tran', 'firstname': 'Phuong Uyen', 'initials': 'PU', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urological Surgery, Barwon Health, University Hospital Geelong, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Grills', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urological Surgery, Barwon Health, University Hospital Geelong, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.\nDepartment of Surgery, School of Medicine, Deakin University, Geelong, Victoria, Australia.'}]",None,None,"Ninety catheters were inserted between 2006 and 2017 in mostly male patients (63%) with a mean age of 60 ± 0.4 years.

32734231",Interdisciplinary Care and Preparedness for Kidney Failure Management in a High-Risk Population.,"Interdisciplinary care may improve health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Few studies have evaluated this model of health care delivery in racial and ethnic minorities.
Retrospective cohort study.
Incident end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients at Montefiore Medical Center from October 1, 2013, to October 31, 2019.
Pre-ESKD interdisciplinary care.
Pre-ESKD transplant listing and optimal kidney replacement therapy (KRT) start (use of arteriovenous access at hemodialysis initiation, outpatient hemodialysis start, preemptive transplant, or peritoneal dialysis as the first modality).
We constructed multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical factors to determine the odds of transplant listing and optimal KRT start between interdisciplinary versus the usual care group.
Of the 295 incident ESKD patients included in our study, 84 received interdisciplinary care and 211 received usual nephrology care. The mean age was 59.9 years (standard deviation, 13.9 years), 47% were women, and 87% were African American or Hispanic. Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups, except that the interdisciplinary care group had a lower prevalence of hypertension (60% vs 75%). Compared with usual care, a higher proportion of patients in the interdisciplinary care group were listed for kidney transplant (44% vs 16%) and had an optimal KRT start (53% vs 44%). Receipt of interdisciplinary care was associated with a higher odds (OR, 5.73; 95% CI, 2.78-11.80;

However, the experience of its use from clinical perspectives post-approval is lacking. Aim Using a clinical practice context, this study aims to compare Roxadustat's effectiveness and tolerability with Erythropoietin (EPO) in patients with renal anemia undergoing dialysis. Methods We examined the clinical records of patients with a diagnosis of renal anemia on dialysis who were prescribed Roxadustat or Erythropoietin at the department of nephrology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University from January 2021 to December 2021. Eligible hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with renal anemia, aged >18 or <75 years, without infection, active bleeding, and malignancy were recruited. These patients received Roxadustat or EPO based on the preferential prescription choice made by the nephrologists of the department. We retrospectively attempted to determine the treatment response measured by the change in hemoglobin rate, from baseline up to six months. We also explored the impact of various factors on the treatment response and reported adverse events. Results A total of 106 patients have been included in the final analysis, with 53 patients in each group. The mean age of the study group was 49.9 ± 13.6 years with the main Hb level at the baseline of 8.1 g/dL ± 1.23 g/dl. The gain of hemoglobin from the baseline averaged over six months was 2.2 ± 2.11 g/dl in the Roxadustat group compared with 1.1 ± 1.67 g/dL in the EPO group (","['chronic kidney disease\xa0(ckd)', 'dialysis', 'effectiveness and safety', 'on dialysis', 'renal anemia', 'roxadustat']",Cureus,2022-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Moussa', 'firstname': 'Oumarou', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, CHN.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, CHN.'}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Cao', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, CHN.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jian Xiong', 'initials': 'JX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, CHN.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xiao Sheng', 'initials': 'XS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, CHN.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Feng Xia', 'initials': 'FX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, CHN.'}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Xian Hu', 'initials': 'XH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, CHN.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2022, Moussa et al.",10.7759/cureus.24427,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17f04b650>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,35475244,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35475244,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan
199,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35470994,[Lymphocytic leukopenia in two patients affected by polycystic kidney disease waiting for renal transplantation].,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease, responsible for 10% of patients on renal replacement therapy. The disease is well known to be associated with many extrarenal manifestations. Leukopenia may also be present, even if it is not commonly identified as a typical extrarenal manifestation. Herein we describe two case reports of ADPKD patients with leukopenia. The first case is about a 47-year-old patient affected by ADPKD, regularly treated with peritoneal dialysis, who showed a progressive reduction of white blood cell count, mostly of lymphocytes. Lymphocytic leukopenia was so severe that, when he was called for transplantation from a deceased donor, he was considered temporarily not eligible. We then describe a second ADPKD patient regularly treated with peritoneal dialysis, who had stable lymphopenia for years. Six years after starting PD, it was necessary to perform bone marrow aspirate to investigate the simultaneous presence of hypogammaglobulinemia together with M-protein and to exclude monoclonal gammopathy. All the exams performed did not show any significant results, the patients were re-included in the waiting list and one of them was transplanted. Given our experience and what is reported in the literature, there seems to be enough evidence to consider leukopenia as an extrarenal manifestation of ADPKD. However, the clinical significance of leukopenia in ADPKD patients is not known. It could be interesting to investigate the leucocytes' function and if ADPKD patients with leukopenia are more susceptible to infection, or not. Moreover, it would be very useful to analyze the relationship between such manifestation and genotype/phenotype.","['ADPKD', 'chronic kidney disease', 'kidney transplant', 'leukopenia', 'lymphopenia']",Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,2022-04-27,"[{'lastname': 'Costa', 'firstname': 'Elisa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Clinica Nefrologica, Dialisi e Trapianto, IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italia; International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza (IRRIV), Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Giuliani', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianto, Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza, Italia; International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza (IRRIV), Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Corradi', 'firstname': 'Valentina', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianto, Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza, Italia; International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza (IRRIV), Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Caprara', 'firstname': 'Carlotta', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza (IRRIV), Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rigato', 'firstname': 'Matteo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianto, Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza, Italia; International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza (IRRIV), Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Milan Manani', 'firstname': 'Sabrina', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianto, Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza, Italia; International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza (IRRIV), Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Tantillo', 'firstname': 'Ilaria', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianto, Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza, Italia; International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza (IRRIV), Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Ronco', 'firstname': 'Claudio', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza (IRRIV), Vicenza, Italia; DIMED, Università di Padova, Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gastaldon', 'firstname': 'Fiorella', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianto, Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza, Italia; International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza (IRRIV), Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Zanella', 'firstname': 'Monica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Dipartimento di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianto, Ospedale San Bortolo, Vicenza, Italia; International Renal Research Institute of Vicenza (IRRIV), Vicenza, Italy.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright by Società Italiana di Nefrologia SIN, Rome, Italy.",None,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17f0652b0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,35470994,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35470994,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

203,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35450846,Peritoneal Dialysis in Advanced Heart Failure Patients with Chronic Severe Congestion Resistant to Optimal Pharmacological Treatment.,"Resistant congestion is a difficult clinical picture in advanced heart failure with poor quality of life, worse functional capacity, and frequent hospitalizations. Optimal medical treatment is the first-line therapy. However, diuretic resistance, comorbid conditions such as chronic kidney disease, and obstacles in drug up-titration make it difficult to control congestion. In some of these cases, hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis is required for short or long-term ultrafiltration therapy. Peritoneal dialysis is a more comfortable treatment option for this group of patients because of the slower and longer duration of ultrafiltration, better preservation of residual renal function, ability to be performed at home, and mobility of the patient during the procedure. In this review, home peritoneal dialysis/ultrafiltration methods have been addressed as an alternative treatment option in advanced heart failure patients with chronic severe congestion resistant to optimal pharmacological treatment.",[],Turk Kardiyoloji Dernegi arsivi : Turk Kardiyoloji Derneginin yayin organidir,2022-04-23,"[{'lastname': 'Murat', 'firstname': 'Selda', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Eskişehir Osmangazi Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi, Kardiyoloji Anabilim Dalı, Eskişehir, Türkiye.'}, {'lastname': 'Özkurt', 'firstname': 'Sultan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Eskişehir Osmangazi Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi, Nefroloji Bilim Dalı, Eskişehir, Türkiye.'}, {'lastname': 'Çavuşoğlu', 'firstname': 'Yüksel', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Eskişehir Osmangazi Üniversitesi Tıp Fakültesi, Kardiyoloji Anabilim Dalı, Eskişehir, Türkiye.'}]",None,None,None,None,10.5543/tkda.2022.21157,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17f0aa340>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,35450846,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35450846,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

14675059","Evaluation of renal replacement therapy in children and adolescents in the state of Amazonas, Brazil.","To describe the characteristics of stage-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) children and adolescents undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) in Amazonas, Brazil, estimating the frequencies of current and new cases, describing the presence of anemia and bone metabolism disorders.
Thirty-five patients aged 7 to 19 years-old on hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) were studied between June 2018 and April 2019. The frequencies of current and new cases were estimated based on the 0 to 19 years-old population of Amazonas, in the same period. Data were collected about the underlying cause and diagnosis of CKD, dialysis, and biochemical analysis.
The frequencies of current and new cases were 24 and 15 patients per million people of compatible age (pmpca), respectively. The causes of CKD were nephrotic syndrome (22.8%), nephritic syndrome (14.3%), and neurogenic bladder (14.3%); in 48.6%, the cause was unknown/not investigated. Ten patients underwent renal biopsy, seven with segmental and focal glomerulosclerosis. The majority (80%) were on HD, with an average kt/V of 1.4, and in 51.4% the vascular access was the double lumen catheter. Hypocalcemia was found in 82.8% of patients, hyperphosphatemia in 57.2%, vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in 60%, and altered parathyroid hormone values in 48.6%. Hemoglobin was low in 80%, with absolute/functional iron deficiency in 28.6%.
In children and adolescents of Amazonas, Brazil, we found 24 pmpca with stage-5 CKU currently in RRT and 16.3 pmpca per year of new cases requiring RRT. Most patients were adolescents on HD, half without a causal diagnosis of CKD, with a high frequency of anemia and bone metabolism disorder.

Foram estudados 35 pacientes de 7 a 19 anos em hemodiálise ou diálise peritoneal (DP) de junho de 2018 a abril de 2019. As frequências de casos atuais e novos foram estimadas com base na população do Amazonas de 0 a 19 anos no mesmo período. Foram coletados dados sobre a doença de base da DRC, seu diagnóstico, a diálise e a análise bioquímica.
As frequências de casos atuais e novos foram 24 e 15 pacientes por milhão de pessoas em idade compatível (pmpic), respectivamente. As causas da DRC foram síndrome nefrótica (22,8%), síndrome nefrítica (14,3%) e bexiga neurogênica (14,3%), com 48,6% de causa ignorada. Dez pacientes fizeram biópsia renal, sendo sete com glomeruloesclerose segmentar e focal. A maioria (80%) fazia hemodiálise, com Kt/V médio de 1,4, sendo o cateter venoso central de duplo lúmen o acesso vascular em 51,4% dos casos. Observou-se hipocalcemia em 82,8% dos pacientes, hiperfosfatemia em 57,2%, insuficiência ou deficiência de vitamina D em 60% e valores do paratormônio alterados em 48,6%. A hemoglobina encontrava-se baixa em 80%, com deficiência absoluta ou funcional de ferro em 28,6%.
Em crianças e adolescentes do Amazonas, Brasil, encontramos uma frequência de 24 pacientes com DRC dialítica e 16.3 pmpic por ano de novos casos.

25257836",A case of 1-month-old female infant delaying peritoneal dialysis introduction by low-potassium anti-allergic formula treated with sodium polystyrene sulfonate.,"The 8806H formula is the only renal formula available for pediatric patients with chronic kidney disease in Japan. A 1-month-old female infant could not be administered 8806H because of milk allergy. Administration of low-potassium anti-allergic formula treated with sodium polystyrene sulfonate maintained adequate serum potassium levels, and introduction of peritoneal dialysis could be delayed. The patient had severe renal dysfunction secondary to bilateral hypoplastic and multi-cystic kidneys. Although she received the 8806H formula, this product was switched to hydrolyzed casein formula because she developed allergy to 8806H at 28 days of age, which led to hyperkalemia. We initiated treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfonate at 40 days of age to lower the potassium concentration in milk, which prevented hyperkalemia and maintained the patient's nutritional status to ensure appropriate increase in body weight. We monitored electrolyte levels in milk and confirmed reduction in potassium levels before feeding. Although such condition is rare and there are few reports of potassium reduction in anti-allergic formulas, this strategy may be useful for pediatric patients with renal insufficiency who cannot be treated with renal formulas because of milk allergy.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Hyperkalemia', 'Infant', 'Milk allergy', 'Sodium polystyrene sulfonate']",CEN case reports,2022-04-21,"[{'lastname': 'Iida', 'firstname': 'Takaya', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Chiba Children's Hospital, 579-1 heta-cho, midori-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba, 266-0007, Japan. i.takaya57382@gmail.com.""}, {'lastname': 'Nishimura', 'firstname': 'Tatsuya', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Chiba Children's Hospital, 579-1 heta-cho, midori-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba, 266-0007, Japan.""}, {'lastname': 'Mizukoshi', 'firstname': 'Yoko', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neonatology, Chiba Children's Hospital, Chiba, Japan.""}, {'lastname': 'Tsuruoka', 'firstname': 'Tomoko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neonatology, Chiba Children's Hospital, Chiba, Japan.""}, {'lastname': 'Hisano', 'firstname': 'Masataka', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Chiba Children's Hospital, 579-1 heta-cho, midori-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba, 266-0007, Japan.""}]",None,None,None,© 2022.

11509469",A Survey Study on Soy Food Consumption in Patients with Chronic Kidney Diseases.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the major and exacerbating global health burdens, which is characterized by no curative treatments and high morbidity and mortality. Since malnutrition has become an important factor determining the final clinical outcomes of CKD, soy products, high-quality plant-based sources of proteins and other nutrients, are recommended by many physicians for CKD patients. However, it has been reported that adherence to this dietary advice among those patients is low. In order to dissect the potential reasons behind this phenomenon and to subsequently develop target intervention to improve the current situation, we designed and conducted a self-administered questionnaire survey in 3 medical centers in China. Total 570 patients responded to our survey and data analysis reveals that 85.6% of the respondents were aware of the necessaries of high-quality protein diets for CKD patients, but only 41.9% of patients knew that soy foods provide high-quality proteins needed. In contrast, up to 90.4% of patients were affected by the notion that patients with CKD should avoid soy products. Besides, comparing with other groups, higher percentage of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis recognized soy products as foods with high-quality proteins, however, as many as 68.8% of them did not consume any soy foods due to the concerns of adverse effects on the progress of CKD. Our data suggest that a significant portion of patients with CKD do not consume soy foods, which could be mainly resulted from their misconception towards soy products delivered by medical workers or social media. Evidence-based updated education of patients and medical workers on soy foods would be a necessary strategy for improving nutrition status of CKD patients and their clinical outcomes.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dietary education', 'plant-based protein diet', 'questionnaire', 'soy products']","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2022-04-19,"[{'lastname': 'Fang', 'firstname': 'Lvgui', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""South District of Guang'anmen Hospital of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Du', 'firstname': 'Yating', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""North District of Guang'anmen Hospital of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Rao', 'firstname': 'Xiangrong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""North District of Guang'anmen Hospital of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China.""}]",None,None,None,None,"10.1177/00469580221093450

12631061",Association between serum β2-microglobulin and mortality in Japanese peritoneal dialysis patients: A cohort study.,"Higher serum β2-microglobulin (B2M) concentrations are associated with higher mortality in the general population, non-dialyzed chronic kidney disease patients and patients receiving hemodialysis (HD). However, this relationship among patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) has not been validated.
We collected baseline data for 3,011 prevalent PD patients from a nationwide dialysis registry in Japan at the end of 2010. Clinical outcomes for 9 years were then evaluated using the registry at the end of 2011 to 2019. All-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality was assessed using Cox regression analysis and competing-risks regression analysis, respectively. We used multiple imputation to deal with missing covariate data.
During a median follow-up of 87 months, 2,054 patients transferred to combined therapy with PD and HD or HD directly. A total of 3,011 patients, 1,235 (41.0%) died, including 437 patients (14.5%) from CV causes. Among them, 612 patients died after transfer to other dialysis modalities. Univariate analyses revealed no significant association between serum B2M and mortality, whereas higher serum B2M was independently associated with both all-cause and CV mortalities in adjusted models. However, the significant association between serum B2M and CV mortality disappeared in analysis treating serum B2M as a categorical variable. The effect of serum B2M on all-cause mortality was significantly higher among patients with higher urinary volume and a significant interaction was evident.
Using a large-scale registry, we found that serum B2M contributes tenuously but significantly to worse outcome and residual kidney function significantly affects this relationship. On the contrary, serum B2M per se had no predictive value for patient outcome in prevalent PD patients.",[],PloS one,2022-04-15,"[{'lastname': 'Maruyama', 'firstname': 'Yukio', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.\nCommittee of Renal Data Registry, Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakayama', 'firstname': 'Masaaki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.""}, {'lastname': 'Abe', 'firstname': 'Masanori', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Committee of Renal Data Registry, Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy, Tokyo, Japan.\nDivision of Nephrology, Hypertension and Endocrinology, Department of Internal Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yokoo', 'firstname': 'Takashi', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Internal Medicine, The Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Minakuchi', 'firstname': 'Jun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kidney Disease, Kawashima Hospital, Tokushima, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nitta', 'firstname': 'Kosaku', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Committee of Renal Data Registry, Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy, Tokyo, Japan.\nFourth Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.""}]",None,None,"During a median follow-up of 87 months, 2,054 patients transferred to combined therapy with PD and HD or HD directly.

Patients were categorized as of the first date they had 2 eGFR assessments or were registered as receiving maintenance dialysis or having received a kidney transplant. eGFR levels were further categorized as ≥60, 45-59, 30-44, 15-29, and <15 mL/min/1.73 m
Overall and site-specific cancer incidence and mortality.
Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard models.
Among 5,882,388 individuals with eGFR data, 29,809 receiving dialysis, and 4,951 having received a kidney transplant, there were 325,895 cancer diagnoses made during 29,993,847 person-years of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of cancer ranged between 10.8% and 15.3% in patients with kidney disease. Compared with patients with eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m
Possible unmeasured confounding and limited ability to infer causal associations.
Cancer incidence in the setting of kidney disease is substantial. Cancer risk was increased in mild to moderate CKD and among transplant recipients, but not in advanced kidney disease. Cancer-related mortality was significantly higher among patients with kidney disease, particularly urologic cancers and myeloma. Strategies to detect and manage these cancers in the CKD population are needed.","['Cancer', 'cancer-related death', 'chronic kidney disease (CKD)', 'end-stage kidney disease (ESKD)', 'glomerular filtration rate (GFR)', 'hemodialysis', 'malignancy', 'multiple myeloma', 'peritoneal dialysis (PD)', 'renal cell carcinoma (RCC)', 'renal function', 'transplantation']",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2022-04-12,"[{'lastname': 'Kitchlu', 'firstname': 'Abhijat', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.

209,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35388439,COVID-19 and Diabetic Nephropathy.,"Diabetic nephropathy is the most common condition that requires a chronic renal replacement therapy, such as hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplantation, or simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplantation. Chronic kidney disease progression, that is the loss of nephrons, which causes the continuous decline of the eGFR, underlies the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became clear that diabetic nephropathy is amongst the independent risk factors that predicts unfavourable outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection. While we still lack conclusive mechanistic insights into how nephrons are rapidly lost upon SARS-CoV2 infection and why patients with diabetic nephropathy are more susceptible to severe outcomes upon SARS-CoV2 infection, here, we discuss several aspects of the interface of COVID-19 with diabetic nephropathy. We identify the shortage of reliable rodent models of diabetic nephropathy, limited treatment options for human diabetic nephropathy and the lack of knowledge about virus-induced signalling pathways of regulated necrosis, such as necroptosis, as key factors that explain our failure to understand this system. Finally, we focus on immunosuppressed patients and discuss vaccination efficacy in these and diabetic patients. We conclude that more basic science and mechanistic understanding will be required both in diabetic nephropathy as well as in host immune responses to the SARS-CoV2 virus if novel therapeutic strategies are desired.",[],Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,2022-04-08,"[{'lastname': 'Maremonti', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Locke', 'firstname': 'Sophie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Tonnus', 'firstname': 'Wulf', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Beer', 'firstname': 'Kristina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Brucker', 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gonzalez', 'firstname': 'Nadia Zamora', 'initials': 'NZ', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Latk', 'firstname': 'Marcus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Belavgeni', 'firstname': 'Alexia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoppenz', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Hugo', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Linkermann', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Dresden University Hospital, Dresden, Germany.\nBiotechnology Center, Technische Universität Dresden, Dresden, Germany.'}]",None,None,None,Thieme.

This is a single-center retrospective cohort study. In total 491 prevalent PD patients (median follow-ups: 34 months) from Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) from January 2004 to December 2017 were included and followed until 30 June 2018. In the first dialysis year, the average levels of serum calcium, albumin-corrected calcium (CorCa), phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were the interested predictors in Cox proportional regression model.
Of these PD patients (age 58 ± 17 years), 52% were male and 36% had diabetic nephropathy. In Cox regression over first-year mean parameters, PTH <100 pg/mL (HR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.94, 
As one of the largest PD cohort study focusing on CKD-MBD, we demonstrated that the level of CKD-MBD markers in the first PD year are independent predictors of all-cause mortality.

34332007",Efficacy and Safety of Daprodustat for Treatment of Anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease in Incident Dialysis Patients: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Daprodustat, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, is being evaluated as an oral alternative to conventional erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy. Few studies of anemia treatment in an incident dialysis (ID) population have been reported.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of daprodustat vs darbepoetin alfa in treating anemia of chronic kidney disease in ID patients.
This prospective, randomized, open-label clinical trial was conducted from May 11, 2017, through September 24, 2020, in 90 centers across 14 countries. Patients with advanced CKD were eligible if they planned to start dialysis within 6 weeks from screening or had started and received hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) within 90 days before randomization, had a screening hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 8.0 to 10.5 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10) and a randomization Hb of 8.0 to 11.0 g/dL, were ESA-naive or had received limited ESA treatment, and were iron-replete.
Randomized 1:1 to daprodustat or darbepoetin alfa.
The primary analysis in the intent-to-treat population evaluated the mean change in Hb concentration from baseline to evaluation period (weeks 28-52) to assess noninferiority of daprodustat vs darbepoetin alfa (noninferiority margin, -0.75 g/dL). The mean monthly intravenous (IV) iron dose from baseline to week 52 was the principal secondary end point. Rates of treatment-emergent and serious adverse events (AEs) were also compared between treatment groups to assess safety and tolerability.
A total of 312 patients (median [IQR] age, 55 [45-65] years; 194 [62%] male) were randomized to either daprodustat (157 patients; median [IQR] age, 52.0 [45-63] years; 96 [61%] male) or darbepoetin alfa (155 patients; median [IQR] age, 56.0 [45-67] years; 98 [63%] male); 306 patients (98%) completed the trial. The mean (SD) Hb concentration during the evaluation period was 10.5 (1.0) g/dL for the daprodustat and 10.6 (0.9) g/dL for the darbepoetin alfa group, with an adjusted mean treatment difference of -0.10 g/dL (95% CI, -0.34 to 0.14 g/dL), indicating noninferiority. There was a reduction in mean monthly IV iron use from baseline to week 52 in both treatment groups; however, daprodustat was not superior compared with darbepoetin alfa in reducing monthly IV iron use (adjusted mean treatment difference, 19.4 mg [95% CI, -11.0 to 49.9 mg]). Adverse event rates were 76% for daprodustat vs 72% for darbepoetin alfa.
This randomized clinical trial found that daprodustat was noninferior to darbepoetin alfa in treating anemia of CKD and may represent a potential oral alternative to a conventional ESA in the ID population.

21799187",Correlation between intestinal flora disruption and protein-energy wasting in patients with end-stage renal disease.,"Different dialysis treatments may affect the composition and structure of the intestinal flora of dialysis-treated chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This study aimed to analyze the correlations between the different flora and the nutritional indexes and further explore the potential metabolic pathways in patients with CKD in end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
Altogether, 102 patients with ESRD were recruited and categorized into the hemodialysis (HD) group (N = 49) and the peritoneal dialysis (PD) group (N = 53). Their biochemical indexes, anthropometric indicators, and inflammatory markers were determined. The total genomic DNA was extracted for 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis was employed for functional analysis.
Anthropometric indicators, including handgrip strength, mid-upper arm circumference, mid-upper arm muscle circumference, and body mass index, in the HD and PD groups showed a positive correlation with butyric acid-producing bacteria (Rosella and Phascolarctobacterium) and a negative correlation with conditional pathogens (Escherichia spp.). Meanwhile, the inflammatory markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, were significantly higher in the PD-protein-energy wasting (PEW) group than in the PD-non-protein-energy wasting (NPEW) group; although they showed an increasing trend in the HD-PEW group, no significant difference was noted. Rosella was considerably scarce in the HD-PEW group than in the HD-NPEW group, whereas Escherichia was substantially more abundant in the PD-PEW group than in the PD-NPEW group. Compared with the HD group, the essential amino acid synthesis pathway, amino acid metabolism-related enzyme pathways, and aminoacyl-transfer RNA biosynthesis pathways were weakened in the PD group. Most carbohydrate metabolic pathways were weakened, although the tricarboxylic acid cycle was slightly enhanced.

33123358",Roxadustat Versus Epoetin Alfa for Treating Anemia in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis: Results from the Randomized Phase 3 ROCKIES Study.,"Concerns regarding cardiovascular safety with current treatments for anemia in patients with dialysis-dependent (DD)-CKD have encouraged the development of alternatives. Roxadustat, an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, stimulates erythropoiesis by increasing endogenous erythropoietin and iron availability.
In this open-label phase 3 study, patients with DD-CKD and anemia were randomized 1:1 to oral roxadustat three times weekly or parenteral epoetin alfa per local clinic practice. Initial roxadustat dose depended on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent dose at screening for patients already on them and was weight-based for those not on them. The primary efficacy end point was mean hemoglobin change from baseline averaged over weeks 28‒52 for roxadustat versus epoetin alfa, regardless of rescue therapy use, tested for noninferiority (margin, -0.75 g/dl). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed.
Among 2133 patients randomized (
Roxadustat effectively increased hemoglobin in patients with DD-CKD, with an AE profile comparable to epoetin alfa.

We conducted a meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccine in patients on RRT.
Eligible studies were identified by systematic literature search in four electronic databases. Twenty-seven studies (4,264 patients) were included for meta-analysis. 99% patients received mRNA vaccine.
Patients on RRT showed inferior seropositivity after two-dosed COVID-19 vaccine, 44% lower than the general population. Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) had significantly lower seropositivity than patients on haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) (26.1 vs. 84.3% and 92.4% respectively, 
Patients on RRT, particularly KTRs, had significantly reduced antibody response after two-dosed COVID-19 vaccination. Vaccination is generally well tolerated.

216,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35349232,Influence of formalized Predialysis Education Program (fPEP) on the chosen and definitive renal replacement therapy option.,"It is widely accepted that patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) should play an active role in the selection of renal replacement therapy (RRT) option. However, patients' knowledge about CKD and treatment options is limited. The implementation of structured education program and shared decision-making may result in a better preparation to RRT, more balanced choice of dialysis modalities and better access to kidney transplantation (TX).
The aim of this long-term study was to assess the impact of formalized Predialysis Education Program (fPEP) on knowlege on RRT options, as well as on selected and definitive therapy.
The study included 435 patients (53% men, mean age 60 years) with CKD stage 4 and 5, participating in fPEP at our center. The program included at least 3 visits, during which balanced information about all RRT options was presented and self-care and informed decision-making were encouraged. The knowledge about RRT options before and after fPEP attendance, and selected and definitive RRT options were assessed.
Ninety-two percent of patients received prior nephrology care. After fPEP completion, in most patients, the knowledge about CKD and RRT options and selected preferred modality improved - 40% of participants chose hemodialysis (HD), 32% peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 18% TX. During the observation period, 4% of patients died before commencement of dialysis, 2.7% received preemptive kidney transplant, 8.6% were placed on transplant waiting list, and 94% started dialysis (30% PD and 70% HD). Among those who chose PD, 69% started PD and 24% started HD; the leading causes of the discrepancy between choosing and receiving PD was the deterioration in clinical condition (50%) and change of decision (32%).
The fPEP increases CKD patients' knowledge on RRT methods. The implementation of a decision-making process based on fPEP leads to a satisfying distribution between modalities, with a good concordance between chosen and definitive modality.","['chronic kidney disease', 'end-stage renal disease', 'modality selection', 'predialysis education', 'renal replacement therapy']",Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,2022-03-30,"[{'lastname': 'Wojtaszek', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Internal Medicine, Warsaw Medical University, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Matuszkiewicz-Rowińska', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Internal Medicine, Warsaw Medical University, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Żebrowski', 'firstname': 'Paweł', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Internal Medicine, Warsaw Medical University, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Głogowski', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Internal Medicine, Warsaw Medical University, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Małyszko', 'firstname': 'Jolanta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis and Internal Medicine, Warsaw Medical University, Poland.'}]",None,None,"Ninety-two percent of patients received prior nephrology care.

26224791",Plant-Based Diets and Peritoneal Dialysis: A Review.,"Whole food plant-based diets are gaining popularity as a preventative and therapeutic modality for numerous chronic health conditions, including chronic kidney disease, but their role and safety in end-stage kidney disease patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is unclear. Given the general public's increased interest in this dietary pattern, it is likely that clinicians will encounter individuals on PD who are either consuming, considering, or interested in learning more about a diet with more plants. This review explores how increasing plant consumption might affect those on PD, encompassing potential benefits, including some specific to the PD population, and potential concerns.","['nutrition', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'plant-based diets']",Nutrients,2022-03-27,"[{'lastname': 'Liebman', 'firstname': 'Scott E', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Joshi', 'firstname': 'Shivam', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, New York University Grossman School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.\nDepartment of Medicine, NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue, New York, NY 10016, USA.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/nu14061304

29097485",First Characterization of ADAMTS-4 in Kidney Tissue and Plasma of Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease-A Potential Novel Diagnostic Indicator.,"Background: We have previously shown that metzincin protease ADAMTS-4 accompanies renal fibrogenesis, as it appears in the blood of hemodialysis patients. Methods: Native kidney (NKB) and kidney transplant (TXCI) biopsy samples as well as plasma from patients with various stages of CKD were compared to controls. In paired analysis, 15 TXCI samples were compared with their zero-time biopsies (TX0). Tissues were evaluated and scored (interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) for NKB and Banff ci for TXCI). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for ADAMTS-4 and BMP-1 was performed. Plasma ADAMTS-4 was detected using ELISA. Results: ADAMTS-4 IHC expression was significantly higher in interstitial compartment (INT) of NKB and TXCI group in peritubular capillaries (PTC) and interstitial stroma (INT). Patients with higher stages of interstitial fibrosis (ci > 1 and IFTA > 1) expressed ADAMTS-4 in INT more frequently in both groups (p = 0.005; p = 0.013; respectively). In paired comparison, TXCI samples expressed ADAMTS-4 in INT and PTC more often than TX0. ADAMTS-4 plasma concentration varied significantly across CKD stages, being highest in CKD 2 and 3 compared to other groups (p = 0.0064). Hemodialysis patients had higher concentrations of ADAMTS-4 compared to peritoneal dialysis (p < 0.00001). Conclusion: ADAMTS-4 might have a significant role in CKD as a potential novel diagnostic indicator.","['ADAMTS-4', 'bone morphogenic protein 1', 'chronic kidney disease', 'kidney transplantation', 'renal dialysis']","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022-03-26,"[{'lastname': 'Vojtusek', 'firstname': 'Ivana Kovacevic', 'initials': 'IK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Arterial Hypertension, Dialysis and Transplantation, University Hospital Center Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Laganovic', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, University Hospital Merkur, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Burek Kamenaric', 'firstname': 'Marija', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Tissue Typing Center, Clinical Department for Transfusion Medicine and Transplantation Biology, University Hospital Center Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bulimbasic', 'firstname': 'Stela', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Department of Pathology and Cytology, University Hospital Center Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Hrkac', 'firstname': 'Stela', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Emergency Medicine, University Hospital Center Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.\nCenter for Translational and Clinical Research, Department of Proteomics, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Salai', 'firstname': 'Grgur', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational and Clinical Research, Department of Proteomics, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.\nTeaching Institute of Emergency Medicine of the City of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ivkovic', 'firstname': 'Vanja', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Arterial Hypertension, Dialysis and Transplantation, University Hospital Center Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.\nDepartment of Public Health, Faculty of Health Studies, University of Rijeka, 51000 Rijeka, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Coric', 'firstname': 'Marijana', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Department of Pathology and Cytology, University Hospital Center Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Novak', 'firstname': 'Rudjer', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational and Clinical Research, Department of Proteomics, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Grgurevic', 'firstname': 'Lovorka', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Center for Translational and Clinical Research, Department of Proteomics, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.\nDepartment of Anatomy, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/diagnostics12030648

19142806",3D Low-Cost Equipment for Automated Peritoneal Dialysis Therapy.,"A breakthrough in peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy occurred in 1977 with the development of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Its simplicity, low cost, and ease with which CAPD could be performed on patients at home contributed to the popularity of this procedure. However, there is a need for continuous improvement in building optimal systems for incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This research showed the design and construction of a simplified prototype of low-cost automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) equipment that meets international standards to automatically regulate infusion and fluid drainage in and out of a patient with low margins of error. Experimental tests allowed the adjustment of the RPM values concerning the flow rate provided. In addition, thanks to the pressure sensor, it was possible to observe a fluctuation ranging from 9 to 13 kPa, which is within the permissible average specified in the catalogs of medical instruments and equipment. Furthermore, a turbidity sensor was added to decrease the possibility of presenting peritonitis. The results showed absolute values of flow, angular velocity, and pressure that it could deliver for use in APD therapies. Finally, the construction of the APD equipment is presented generally, showing the electronic and mechanical components that constitute it.","['automated peritoneal dialysis', 'biomechanics', 'chronic renal disease', 'peristaltic pump']","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2022-03-26,"[{'lastname': 'Rivero-Urzua', 'firstname': 'Samuel', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica Unidad Zacatenco, Sección de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigación, Ciudad de Mexico 07738, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Paredes-Rojas', 'firstname': 'Juan Carlos', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Centro Mexicano para la Producción más Limpia, Acueducto de Guadalupe S/N, La laguna Ticomán, Ciudad de Mexico 07340, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Méndez-García', 'firstname': 'Sergio Rodrigo', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': 'Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica Unidad Zacatenco, Sección de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigación, Ciudad de Mexico 07738, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Ortiz-Hernández', 'firstname': 'Fernando Eli', 'initials': 'FE', 'affiliation': 'Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica, Unidad Culhuacán, Ciudad de Mexico 04260, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Oropeza-Osornio', 'firstname': 'Armando', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica, Unidad Ticomán, Ciudad de Mexico 07340, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Torres-SanMiguel', 'firstname': 'Christopher René', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Escuela Superior de Ingeniería Mecánica y Eléctrica Unidad Zacatenco, Sección de Estudios de Posgrado e Investigación, Ciudad de Mexico 07738, Mexico.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/healthcare10030564

The present study aimed to evaluate TARC as a Th2-associated marker with chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) in patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD).
This single-centre cross-sectional study included patients who underwent PD in our hospital between August 2020 and July 2021. The severity and impaired quality of life (QOL) of CKD-aP were assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and Japanese version of the 5-D itch scale (5D-J), respectively.
A total of 48 patients with PD were included in the present study. Age and dialysis vintage were (mean ± SD) 64.8 ± 12.0 year and (median (IQR)) 38.5 (11.5-91.5) month, respectively. VAS and 5D-J scores were 3.3 ± 2.0 and 10.5 (9.0-12.0), respectively. Serum TARC level was 481.5 (278.9-603.4) pg/mL (upper limits of normal 450 pg/mL) and significantly correlated with VAS (

32106198",Chronic kidney disease in Ecuador: An epidemiological and health system analysis of an emerging public health crisis.,"The absence of a chronic kidney disease (CKD) registry in Ecuador makes it difficult to assess the burden of disease, but there is an anticipated increase in the incidence of CKD along with increasing diabetes, hypertension and population age. From 2012, augmented funding for renal replacement therapy expanded dialysis clinics and patient coverage. We conducted 73 in-depth sociological interviews with healthcare providers in eight provinces and collected quantitative epidemiological data on patients with CKD diagnoses from six national-level databases between 2015 and 2018. Datasets show a total of 17,484 dialysis patients in 2018, or 567 patients per million population (pmp), with an annual cost exceeding 11% of Ecuador's public health budget. Each year, there were 139-162 pmp new dialysis patients, while doctors reported waiting lists. The number of patients on peritoneal dialysis was static; those on hemodialysis increased over time. Only 13 of 24 provinces were found to have dialysis services, and nephrologists were clustered in major cities, which limits access, delays medical attention, and adds a travel burden on patients. Prevention and screening programs are scarce, while hospitalization is an important reality for CKD patients. CKD is an emerging public health crisis that has increased dramatically over the last decade in Ecuador and is expected to continue, making coverage for all patients impossible and the current structure, unsustainable. A patient registry would help health policymakers and administrators estimate the demand and progression of patients with consideration for comorbidities, disease stage, requirements and costs, mortality and follow-up. This should be used to help identify where to focus prevention and improved treatment efforts. Organized monitoring of CKD patients would benefit from improvements in patient referral. Community-based education and prevention programs, the strengthening of primary healthcare capacity (including basic routine tests) and improved nephrology services are also urgently needed.",[],PloS one,2022-03-17,"[{'lastname': 'Torres', 'firstname': 'Irene', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Fundacion Octaedro, Quito, Ecuador.'}, {'lastname': 'Sippy', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.\nUniversity of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Bardosh', 'firstname': 'Kevin Louis', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Center for One Health Research, School of Public Health, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Bhargava', 'firstname': 'Ramya', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Lotto-Batista', 'firstname': 'Martín', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, Brunswick, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bideaux', 'firstname': 'Abigail E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia-Trabanino', 'firstname': 'Ramon', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centro de Hemodiálisis, San Salvador, El Salvador.\nEmergency Social Fund for Health, Tierra Blanca, El Salvador.'}, {'lastname': 'Goldsmith', 'firstname': 'Amelia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Narsipur', 'firstname': 'Sriram S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Stewart-Ibarra', 'firstname': 'Anna M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.\nInter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI), Montevideo, Uruguay.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.1371/journal.pone.0265395

34244326","Safety and effectiveness of ferric citrate hydrate in serum phosphorus management of patients with chronic kidney disease: a long-term, real-world, observational, post-marketing surveillance study.","Ferric citrate hydrate (FC) is an oral iron-based phosphate binder that is used to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This post-marketing surveillance study was performed to investigate the long-term safety and effectiveness of FC.
This prospective, multicenter, observational post-marketing surveillance study was performed in a real-world setting in Japan. The study involved CKD patients with hyperphosphatemia receiving FC who were undergoing either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis or were non-dialysis-dependent. Adverse drug reactions, iron- and erythrocyte-related parameters (i.e., levels of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and hemoglobin), and serum levels of phosphorus, corrected calcium, and intact parathyroid hormone were monitored for up to 104 weeks.
Safety was evaluated in 2723 patients. Of these patients, 20.5% discontinued FC because of adverse events, and 3.9% discontinued FC because of unsatisfactory effectiveness. Iron-related parameters gradually increased after the initiation of FC treatment but stabilized after week 36. Effectiveness was analyzed in 2367 patients. Serum phosphorus immediately decreased, and the effect persisted for 104 weeks.
In this 104 week surveillance study, no new safety concerns were noted. The safety profile was not obviously different from those in pre-approval clinical trials and the 52 week interim report of this surveillance study. The serum ferritin level of most patients was below the upper limit of the target range, and iron overload risk was not evident. Long-term FC treatment effectively controlled serum phosphorus.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Dialysis', 'Ferric citrate', 'Hyperphosphatemia', 'Long-term safety', 'Non-dialysis-dependent']",Clinical and experimental nephrology,2022-03-09,"[{'lastname': 'Yokoyama', 'firstname': 'Keitaro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Science, The Graduate School, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-Shinbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 105-8461, Japan. keitaro@jikei.ac.jp.\nHarumi Triton Clinic of The Jikei University Hospital Harumi Island Triton Square Office Tower, W3 Floor 1-8-8 Harumi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 104-0053, Japan. keitaro@jikei.ac.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Hashimoto', 'firstname': 'Teruo', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Pharmaceutical Division, Japan Tobacco Inc., 3-4-1 Nihonbashi-Honcho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 103-0023, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Okuda', 'firstname': 'Yuri', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Pharmaceutical Division, Japan Tobacco Inc., 3-4-1 Nihonbashi-Honcho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 103-0023, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Matsumoto', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Pharmaceutical Division, Japan Tobacco Inc., 3-4-1 Nihonbashi-Honcho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 103-0023, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ito', 'firstname': 'Kyoko', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Medical Affairs Department, Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, 3-4-1 Nihonbashi-Honcho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 103-0023, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamada', 'firstname': 'Ryoichi', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Pharmaceutical Division, Japan Tobacco Inc., 3-4-1 Nihonbashi-Honcho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 103-0023, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Susai', 'firstname': 'Hiroyuki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Pharmaceutical Division, Japan Tobacco Inc., 3-4-1 Nihonbashi-Honcho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 103-0023, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nishino', 'firstname': 'Noriaki', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacovigilance Department, Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, 3-4-1 Nihonbashi-Honcho, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, 103-0023, Japan.'}]",None,"In this 104 week surveillance study, no new safety concerns were noted.

31155777",Kidney Supportive Care in Peritoneal Dialysis: Developing a Person-Centered Kidney Disease Care Plan.,"Individuals receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD)-similar to those receiving hemodialysis -may experience high mortality coupled with a high symptom burden and reduced health-related quality of life. In this context, a discussion of the risks, benefits, and tradeoffs of PD and/or other kidney treatment modalities should be explored based on individual goals and preferences. Through these principles, kidney supportive care provides a person-centered approach to kidney disease care throughout the spectrum of kidney failure and earlier stages of chronic kidney disease. Kidney supportive care is offered in conjunction with life-prolonging therapies, including dialysis and kidney transplants, and is increasingly recognized as an integral part of advancing the care of PD patients. Using ""My Kidney Care Roadmap"" for shared decision making, kidney supportive care guides patients undergoing PD and their clinicians to (1) elicit patient goals, values, and priorities; (2) convey medical prognosis and suitable treatment options; and (3) ask ""Which of these kidney treatment options will best help me achieve my goals and priorities?"" to inform both current and future decisions, including choice of dialysis modalities, time-limited trials, and/or nondialysis management. Recognizing that patient priorities and choices may evolve, this framework ultimately allows patients to continually reassess their PD care to better achieve goal-directed dialysis.","['Advance care planning', 'chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'end-stage kidney disease', 'end-stage renal disease', 'kidney failure', 'kidney supportive care', 'palliative care', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'renal failure', 'renal palliative care', 'shared decision-making', 'supportive care']",Kidney medicine,2022-03-05,"[{'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.\nBrookdale Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.'}, {'lastname': 'Chai', 'firstname': 'Emily', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.\nBrookdale Department of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.'}]",None,None,None,© 2021 The Authors.,"10.1016/j.xkme.2021.10.005

This study aimed to compare the effects of sevelamer used as a second-line, low-dose therapy with calcium-based phosphorus binders with those of sevelamer used as a first-line, high-dose therapy on coronary artery and heart valve calcification, aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), and calcification propensity over 2 years in patients with hyperphosphatemia receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD).
A 2-year-long prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized pilot study.
Prevalent patients with hyperphosphatemia receiving PD from 2 university-affiliated hospitals in Hong Kong.
The patients were randomized to receive sevelamer either as a first-line therapy at a high dose of 800 mg thrice daily (can titrate up to 1,200 mg thrice daily as required) or a second-line therapy at a low dose of 400 mg thrice daily with calcium carbonate to achieve a serum phosphorus target of ≤5.5 mg/dL.
The primary endpoints were changes in coronary artery calcium score and aortic PWV over 104 weeks. The secondary endpoints were changes in heart valve calcium scores, calcification propensity measure, and biochemical parameters of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disease over 104 weeks.
Among 60 prevalent patients receiving PD, with a mean age of 53 ± 10 years and with 57% men, changes in the coronary artery calcium score (median [interquartile range], 225 [79-525] vs 223 [56-1,212], respectively; 
The sample size was small, and the dropout rates were relatively high.
Low-dose sevelamer used as a second-line therapy for hyperphosphatemia in combination with a calcium-based phosphorus binder had similar effects on vascular calcification, valvular calcification, and arterial stiffness compared with high-dose sevelamer used as a first-line therapy. This approach may be considered in resource-constrained countries to minimize calcium loading.
The study was supported by a competitive grant from SK Yee Medical Foundation. T50 assays and other biochemical assays were funded by a research grant from Sanofi Renal Corporation.

31228535",Symptom clusters in chronic kidney disease and their association with people's ability to perform usual activities.,"People living with a long-term condition, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), often suffer from multiple symptoms simultaneously, making symptom management challenging. This study aimed to identify symptom clusters in adults with CKD across treatment groups and investigate their association with people's ability to perform their usual activities.
We conducted a secondary analysis of both cross-sectional and longitudinal data collected as part of a national service improvement programme in 14 kidney centres in England, UK. This data included symptom severity (17 items, POS-S Renal) and the extent to which people had problems performing their usual activities (single item, EQ-5D-5L). We categorised data by treatment group: haemodialysis (n = 1,462), transplantation (n = 866), peritoneal dialysis (n = 127), or CKD without kidney replacement therapy (CKD non-KRT; n = 684). We used principal component analysis to identify symptom clusters per treatment group, and proportional odds models to assess the association between clusters and usual activities.
Overall, clusters related to: lack of energy and mobility; gastrointestinal; skin; and mental health. Across groups, the 'lack of energy and mobility' clusters were associated with having problems with usual activities, with odds ratios (OR) ranging between 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-1.57) for haemodialysis and 1.56 for peritoneal dialysis (95% CI, 1.28-1.90). This association was confirmed longitudinally in haemodialysis (n = 399) and transplant (n = 249) subgroups.
Our findings suggest that healthcare professionals should consider routinely assessing symptoms in the 'lack of energy & mobility' cluster in all people with CKD, regardless of whether they volunteer this information; not addressing these symptoms is likely to be related to them having problems with performing usual activities. Future studies should explore why symptoms within clusters commonly co-occur and how they interrelate. This will inform the development of cluster-level symptom management interventions with enhanced potential to improve outcomes for people with CKD.",[],PloS one,2022-03-03,"[{'lastname': 'Moore', 'firstname': 'Currie', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Health Research Methods Unit, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Santhakumaran', 'firstname': 'Shalini', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'UK Renal Registry, Bristol, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Glen P', 'initials': 'GP', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Informatics, Division of Informatics, Imaging and Data Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilkinson', 'firstname': 'Thomas J', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'Leicester Kidney Lifestyle Team, Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Caskey', 'firstname': 'Fergus J', 'initials': 'FJ', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.\nRenal Unit, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Magadi', 'firstname': 'Winnie', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'UK Renal Registry, Bristol, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Gair', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Renal Association, Bristol, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Alice C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Leicester Kidney Lifestyle Team, Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Wellsted', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Health Research Methods Unit, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Veer', 'firstname': 'Sabine N', 'initials': 'SN', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Informatics, Division of Informatics, Imaging and Data Sciences, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}]",None,None,"Overall, clusters related to: lack of energy and mobility; gastrointestinal; skin; and mental health.

228,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35227067,[Usefulness of a nutritional strategy on dyslipidemia in pediatric patients with terminal chronic kidney disease].,"Background and objective: in chronic kidney disease (CKD) there are several factors that increase the presence of dyslipidemia. The aim of this study was to identify the usefulness of a nutritional intervention, in children with terminal CKD, on dyslipidemia 6 months after intervention start. Materials and methods: a quasi-experiment study (before and after) was performed. End-stage CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis were included. Each child underwent a determination somatometry, and lipid profile at the beginning and at 6 months of follow-up. A nutritional guide was made with food traffic lights, turning the food that should be consumed in the least amount possible in red. In addition to including life-size food using educational models. To compare the quantitative variables before and after the intervention, the variables were transformed to their logarithm and a paired Student's t-test was applied. Results: a total of 41 patients were analyzed. After the intervention, the parameters in the lipid profile were modified; meanwhile HDL concentrations increased (41.0 mg/dL vs 44.4 mg/dL, p = 0.048), triglyceride concentrations decreased (227.1 mg/dL vs 185.9 mg/dL, p = 0.007), and these changes persist even after excluding patients who were under lipid-lowering treatment (195 mg/dL vs 171.6, p = 0.049). Regarding the state of dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia decreased, without reaching significance (80.5 % vs 62.5 %, p = 0.073). Conclusions: the nutritional intervention improved HDL and triglyceride concentrations 6 months afterwards in children with terminal CKD.
Antecedentes y objetivo: en la enfermedad renal crónica (ERC) existen múltiples factores que incrementan la presencia de la dislipidemia. El objetivo fue identificar la utilidad de una intervención nutricional sobre la dislipidemia, en niños con ERC terminal, a los 6 meses del inicio de la intervención. Materiales y métodos: estudio cuasiexperimental (antes y después). Se incluyeron pacientes con ERC terminal en diálisis peritoneal y hemodiálisis. A cada niño se le realizaron una somatometría y un perfil de lípidos al inicio y a los 6 meses de seguimiento. Se realizó un manual de alimentación con semaforización de los alimentos, poniendo de color rojo los alimentos que se deben consumir en la menor cantidad posible, además de incluir alimentos a tamaño real utilizando modelos educativos. Para comparar las variables cuantitativas antes y después de la intervención se transformaron las variables a su logaritmo y se aplicó la “t” de Student pareada. Resultados: se analizaron 41 pacientes. Posteriormente a la intervención se modificaron los parámetros del perfil lipídico; las concentraciones de HDL se incrementaron (41,0 mg/dL vs. 44,4 mg/dL, p = 0,048), mientras que las concentraciones de triglicéridos disminuyeron (227,1 mg/dL vs. 185.9 mg/dL, p = 0,007), lo cual persiste incluso una vez excluidos aquellos pacientes que se encontraban bajo tratamiento hipolipemiante (195 mg/dL vs. 171,6, p = 0,049). En cuanto al estado de dislipidemia, la hipertrigliceridemia disminuyó sin alcanzar la significancia (80,5 % vs. 62,5 %, p = 0,073).

29741651",Comparative Effectiveness of Dialysis Modality on Laboratory Parameters of Mineral Metabolism.,"Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) are prevalent in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis. Yet, there are limited and mixed evidence on the effects of different dialysis modalities involving longer treatment times or higher frequencies on CKD-MBD markers.
This cohort study used data from 132,523 incident dialysis patients treated with any of the following modalities: conventional thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis, nocturnal in-center hemodialysis (NICHD), home hemodialysis (HHD), or peritoneal dialysis (PD) from 2007 to 2011. We used marginal structural models fitted with inverse probability weights to adjust for fixed and time-varying confounding and informative censoring. We estimated the average effects of treatments with different dialysis modalities on time-varying serum concentrations of CKD-MBD markers: albumin-corrected calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) using pooled linear regression.
Most of the cohort were exclusively treated with conventional in-center hemodialysis, while few were ever treated with NICHD or HHD. At the baseline, PD patients had the lowest mean and median values of PTH, while NICHD patients had the highest median values. During follow-up, compared to hemodialysis patients, patients treated with NICHD had lower mean serum PTH (19.8 pg/mL [95% confidence interval: 2.8, 36.8] lower), whereas PD and HHD patients had higher mean PTH (39.7 pg/mL [31.6, 47.8] and 51.2 pg/mL [33.0, 69.3] higher, respectively). Compared to hemodialysis patients, phosphate levels were lower for patients treated with NICHD (0.44 mg/dL [0.37, 0.52] lower), PD (0.15 mg/dL [0.12, 0.19] lower), or HHD (0.33 mg/dL [0.27, 0.40] lower). There were no clinically meaningful associations between dialysis modalities and concentrations of calcium or ALP.
In incident dialysis patients, compared to treatment with conventional in-center hemodialysis, treatments with other dialysis modalities with longer treatment times or higher frequency were associated with different patterns of serum phosphate and PTH. Given the recent growth in the use of dialysis modalities other than hemodialysis, the associations between the treatment and the CKD-MBD markers warrant additional study.","['Extended-hours hemodialysis', 'In-center hemodialysis', 'Maintenance dialysis', 'Marginal structural model', 'Mineral and bone disorders', 'Nocturnal hemodialysis', 'Peritoneal dialysis']",American journal of nephrology,2022-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Soohoo', 'firstname': 'Melissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Harold Simmons Center for Kidney Disease Research and Epidemiology, University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, California, USA.\nNephrology Section, Tibor Rubin Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Long Beach, California, USA.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Obi', 'firstname': 'Yoshitsugu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, Mississippi, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rivara', 'firstname': 'Matthew B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Adams', 'firstname': 'Scott V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': 'Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lau', 'firstname': 'Wei Ling', 'initials': 'WL', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Harold Simmons Center for Kidney Disease Research and Epidemiology, University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rhee', 'firstname': 'Connie M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Harold Simmons Center for Kidney Disease Research and Epidemiology, University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kovesdy', 'firstname': 'Csaba P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Section, Memphis Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.\nDivision of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kalantar-Zadeh', 'firstname': 'Kamyar', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Harold Simmons Center for Kidney Disease Research and Epidemiology, University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, California, USA.\nNephrology Section, Tibor Rubin Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Long Beach, California, USA.\nDepartment of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Arah', 'firstname': 'Onyebuchi A', 'initials': 'OA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, California, USA.\nDepartment of Statistics, College of Letters and Science, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Los Angeles, California, USA.\nSection for Epidemiology, Department of Public Health, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Mehrotra', 'firstname': 'Rajnish', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Streja', 'firstname': 'Elani', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Harold Simmons Center for Kidney Disease Research and Epidemiology, University of California Irvine Medical Center, Orange, California, USA.\nNephrology Section, Tibor Rubin Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Long Beach, California, USA.'}]",None,"In incident dialysis patients, compared to treatment with conventional in-center hemodialysis, treatments with other dialysis modalities with longer treatment times or higher frequency were associated with different patterns of serum phosphate and PTH.

230,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35226403,Exploring patients' experiences of the impact of dialysis therapies on quality of life and wellbeing.,"When people with chronic kidney disease reach kidney failure, renal replacement therapy is usually required to improve symptoms and maintain life. Although in-centre haemodialysis is most commonly used for this purpose, other forms of dialysis are available, including home haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
We aimed to explore the experiences of adults living with chronic kidney disease who were either approaching the need for dialysis or had reached kidney failure and were receiving a form of dialysis. In particular, we explored how different forms of dialysis affect their quality of life, wellbeing, and physical activity.
Individual semistructured interviews were conducted with 40 adults with kidney failure, comprising four groups (n = 10 each): those receiving in-centre haemodialysis, home haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, or predialysis. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, thematically analysed, and then composite vignettes were subsequently developed to present a rich narrative of the collective experiences of each group.
Compared with adults who were predialysis, quality of life and wellbeing improved upon initiation of their home haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Conversely, minimal improvement was perceived by those receiving in-centre haemodialysis. Low physical activity was reported across all four groups, although those receiving home haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis reported a greater desire and ability to be physically active than those in-centre.
These findings highlight that dialysis modalities not requiring regular hospital attendance (i.e., home haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) improve independence, quality of life, wellbeing, and can facilitate a more physically active lifestyle.","['home haemodialysis', 'patient experience', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'quality of Life']",Journal of renal care,2022-03-01,"[{'lastname': 'Antoun', 'firstname': 'Joe', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science and Health, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK.\nAcademic Department of Renal Medicine, Wessex Kidney Centre, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Portsmouth, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Daniel J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science and Health, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'Daniel J W', 'initials': 'DJW', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading, Reading, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Clarkson', 'firstname': 'Beth G', 'initials': 'BG', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science and Health, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Shepherd', 'firstname': 'Anthony I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science and Health, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK.\nAcademic Department of Renal Medicine, Wessex Kidney Centre, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Portsmouth, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Sangala', 'firstname': 'Nicholas C', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'Academic Department of Renal Medicine, Wessex Kidney Centre, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Portsmouth, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Lewis', 'firstname': 'Robert J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Academic Department of Renal Medicine, Wessex Kidney Centre, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Portsmouth, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'McNarry', 'firstname': 'Melitta A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Applied Sports, Technology, Exercise and Medicine Research Centre (A-STEM), School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Swansea University, Swansea, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Mackintosh', 'firstname': 'Kelly A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Applied Sports, Technology, Exercise and Medicine Research Centre (A-STEM), School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Swansea University, Swansea, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Mason', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Applied Sports, Technology, Exercise and Medicine Research Centre (A-STEM), School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Swansea University, Swansea, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Corbett', 'firstname': 'Jo', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science and Health, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Saynor', 'firstname': 'Zoe L', 'initials': 'ZL', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences, Faculty of Science and Health, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK.\nAcademic Department of Renal Medicine, Wessex Kidney Centre, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, Portsmouth, UK.'}]",None,"These findings highlight that dialysis modalities not requiring regular hospital attendance (i.e., home haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) improve independence, quality of life, wellbeing, and can facilitate a more physically active lifestyle.",None,© 2022 The Authors.

33891660",COVID-19 Vaccination Improved Psychological Distress (Anxiety and Depression Scores) in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients: A Prospective Study.,"The purpose of the study is to analyze the impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 on anxiety and depression scores in patients with different modalities of chronic kidney disease. One hundred and seventeen renal patients (50 hemodialysis patients, 13 peritoneal dialysis patients, 32 kidney transplants, and 22 advanced chronic kidney disease patients at pre-dialysis care) were evaluated for depression, anxiety, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and perceived fears and resources with standardized (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) and self-reported questionnaires. The measure points were before vaccination and 15 days after vaccination. The main finding of the study was that there was a decrease in the global mean of normal scores for anxiety and depression symptoms in chronic kidney disease patients post-vaccination. We did not find statistically significant differences in depression or anxiety scores, nor any HRQOL differences between the treatment groups. The three main fears reported by the participants at baseline were those of adverse effects, not getting the vaccine, and lack of information. These findings highlight the potential interest of assessing psychological variables related to the impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.

31998376",The Latin American Dialysis and Renal Transplantation Registry: report 2019.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Latin America (LA) continues to represent a challenge due to the burden of disease it causes and the difficulty in accessing treatment. LA has a total population of 652 million people living in 20 countries that occupy an area of 19.2 million km
Participating countries complete an annual survey collecting aggregated data on incident and prevalent patients on KRT in all modalities. The different treatment modalities considered were hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and living functioning kidney graft (LFG). National gross domestic product per capita (GDP, expressed in US dollars) and life expectancy at birth (LEB) corresponding to the year 2019 were collected from the World Bank Data Bank. Prevalence and incidence were compared with previous years and were also correlated with GDP and LEB.
On 31 December 2019 a total of 432 610 patients were in KRT in LA, corresponding to an overall unadjusted prevalence of 866 per million population (pmp). Regarding treatment modality, 66.7% of the prevalent patients were treated with HD and 9.3% with PD while 24% of the patients had an LFG. A total of 85 224 patients started KRT in LA, representing a total unadjusted incidence rate of 168 pmp. Diabetic nephropathy as a cause of CKD continues to be a relevant percentage (36%) and five countries reported CKD of nontraditional causes. The kidney transplant rate in the region was 22 pmp, varying from 1 to >60 pmp. The total prevalence of KRT correlated positively with GDP per capita (

22052662",The effects of peritoneal dialysis on QT interval in ESRD patients.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at a high risk of fatal arrhythmias. The extended corrected QT (QTc) interval is a hallmark of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Previous studies have shown that QT interval and QTc are prolonged with the decline in renal function. However, there were no available results for patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD). In this study, we examined changes in QT interval and QTc in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who underwent peritoneal dialysis.
A total of 66 ESRD patients who received PD, including 50 males and 16 females, with an average age of 43.56 ± 15.15 years, were enrolled. The follow-up lasted 1 year. The demographics and the etiology of patients were recorded. QTc and clinical/biochemical indexes before dialysis and at 6 and 12 months were determined and analyzed. Dialysis adequacy and peritoneal transport function were assessed in each patient. Analysis of variance (ANOVA), least significant difference (LSD) or Tamhane's T2, Paired T-test, Chi-square test, multiple linear regression analysis, and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to analyze the data. P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
With reference to etiology, 37 patients (56.06%) had chronic nephritis, and 11 (16.67%) had diabetic nephropathy. Most of the peritoneal transport functions were low average transport (25, 37.88%), while the least were high transport (2, 3.03%).During the follow-up period, all patients had adequate peritoneal dialysis. Compared with a baseline before dialysis, anemia, low albumin, blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone improved after 6 and 12 months, while the residual renal function gradually decreased during the follow-up. The mean QTc of all patients was stable during the follow-up period. According to gender, the QTc in males and female patients were similar. Before PD, diastolic blood pressure, calcium concentration, and hemoglobin level were negatively correlated with QTc in end-stage renal disease patients; After PD, the observed clinical indexes were no longer relevant to QTc.
Unlike hemodialysis-induced QTc prolongation, PD did not increase the patient's QT interval and QTc interval, which suggested that myocardial electrical activity might be more stable in patients with adequate peritoneal dialysis.","['Corrected QT interval (QTc)', 'Peritoneal Dialysis', 'QT interval']",BMC nephrology,2022-02-20,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Wenjing', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 277 West Yanta Road, Xi'an, 710061, Shannxi, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liang', 'firstname': 'Yu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 277 West Yanta Road, Xi'an, 710061, Shannxi, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Lv', 'firstname': 'Jia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 277 West Yanta Road, Xi'an, 710061, Shannxi, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 277 West Yanta Road, Xi'an, 710061, Shannxi, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Jiping', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, 277 West Yanta Road, Xi'an, 710061, Shannxi, China. jipingsundwy@126.com.""}]",None,"Unlike hemodialysis-induced QTc prolongation, PD did not increase the patient's QT interval and QTc interval, which suggested that myocardial electrical activity might be more stable in patients with adequate peritoneal dialysis.","With reference to etiology, 37 patients (56.06%) had chronic nephritis, and 11 (16.67%) had diabetic nephropathy.

34281407",Neuroimmunoendocrine Link Between Chronic Kidney Disease and Olfactory Deficits.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a multifactorial pathology that progressively leads to the deterioration of metabolic functions and results from deficient glomerular filtration and electrolyte imbalance. Its economic impact on public health is challenging. Mexico has a high prevalence of CKD that is strongly associated with some of the most common metabolic disorders like diabetes and hypertension. The gradual loss of kidney functions provokes an inflammatory state and endocrine alterations affecting several systems. High serum levels of prolactin have been associated with CKD progression, inflammation, and olfactory function. Also, the nutritional status is altered due to impaired renal function. The decrease in calorie and protein intake is often accompanied by malnutrition, which can be severe at advanced stages of the disease. Nutrition and olfactory functioning are closely interconnected, and CKD patients often complain of olfactory deficits, which ultimately can lead to deficient food intake. CKD patients present a wide range of deficits in olfaction like odor discrimination, identification, and detection threshold. The chronic inflammatory status in CKD damages the olfactory epithelium leading to deficiencies in the chemical detection of odor molecules. Additionally, the decline in cognitive functioning impairs the capacity of odor differentiation. It is not clear whether peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis improve the olfactory deficits, but renal transplants have a strong positive effect. In the present review, we discuss whether the olfactory deficiencies caused by CKD are the result of the induced inflammatory state, the hyperprolactinemia, or a combination of both.","['chronic kidney disease', 'neuroinflammation', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory deficit', 'olfactory epithelium', 'prolactin']",Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,2022-02-18,"[{'lastname': 'Corona', 'firstname': 'Rebeca', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Neurobiología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Querétaro, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Ordaz', 'firstname': 'Benito', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Neurobiología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Querétaro, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Robles-Osorio', 'firstname': 'Ludivina', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Nutrición, Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro, Querétaro, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Sabath', 'firstname': 'Ernesto', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Facultad de Nutrición, Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro, Querétaro, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Morales', 'firstname': 'Teresa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Neurobiología, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Querétaro, Mexico.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2022 Corona, Ordaz, Robles-Osorio, Sabath and Morales.","10.3389/fnint.2022.763986

235,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35166916,Reduction in peritonitis rates: 18-year results from the most active pediatric peritoneal dialysis center in China.,"Most of the available epidemiological data on peritonitis have been derived from developed countries. Limited data from China have been reported.
An 18-year (2001-2018) peritoneal dialysis (PD) program at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University was described, and data on peritonitis were retrospectively analyzed.
Since 2001, a program with a comprehensive PD care bundle has been developed, and 283 patients (53.7% male, median age 9.3 years) were enrolled between 2001 and 2018. Among these patients, 117 peritonitis episodes occurred in 68 (24.0%) patients over 4896 patient-months. The peritonitis rate decreased 20-fold from 2.2 episodes per patient-year in 2003 to 0.11 episodes in 2018. The culture-negative rate decreased from 68.7% during 2001-2006 to 18.5% during 2013-2018, and the proportion of gram-negative and fungal infections increased significantly from 6.6 to 33.8% and 0 to 9.2%, respectively (p < 0.001). Short stature as height ≤  - 2 SD (OR 2.35, 95% CI 1.30-4.24, p = 0.005) and PD duration ≥ 1 year (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.76-6.49, p < 0.001) were independently associated with a higher risk of developing peritonitis. Of the 117 peritonitis episodes, 9.4% required permanent removal of the catheter, among which half were fungal infections. Patients with peritonitis had a higher risk for PD technique failure (p = 0.006), but there was no difference in estimated patient survival rates and no patient death due to peritonitis.
With the successful development of the PD program and care bundles per the International Society of Pediatric Dialysis (ISPD) guidelines, peritonitis rates have been tremendously reduced in the most active pediatric PD center in China. Growth deficits and a long PD duration were risk factors for developing peritonitis, requiring further close monitoring for a better outcome.

29356775",Local anesthetics for the Nephrologist.,"Several specialists in medicine use local anesthetics. In patients with kidney disease, these agents are used during catheter insertions for hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, arteriovenous fistula and graft procedures, kidney transplantation, parathyroidectomy, kidney biopsies, and dental and skin procedures. Patients on chronic hemodialysis use a topical application prior to use of needles for arteriovenous fistula cannulation before starting dialysis. They are also used to manage acute and chronic pain conditions, in regional nerve blockade and in multi-modal enhanced recovery protocols. Despite their frequent use by both physicians and patients, data on the use of local anesthetics in patients with kidney impairment are not well reported. This review will summarize the use of local anesthetics in chronic kidney disease, describe their pharmacology and the impact of lower estimated glomerular filtration rate on their pharmacokinetics, and suggest dose regulation in those with kidney dysfunction.","['chronic kidney disease', 'local anesthetics', 'pharmacology']",Clinical kidney journal,2022-02-12,"[{'lastname': 'Uppal', 'firstname': 'Nupur N', 'initials': 'NN', 'affiliation': 'Division of Kidney Diseases and Hypertension, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Northwell Health, Great Neck, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jhaveri', 'firstname': 'Mital', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, Queens Hospital Center, Jamaica, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hong', 'firstname': 'Susana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Kidney Diseases and Hypertension, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Northwell Health, Great Neck, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shore-Lesserson', 'firstname': 'Linda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jhaveri', 'firstname': 'Kenar D', 'initials': 'KD', 'affiliation': 'Division of Kidney Diseases and Hypertension, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Northwell Health, Great Neck, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Izzedine', 'firstname': 'Hassan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Peupliers Private Hospital, Ramsay Générale de Santé, Paris, France.'}]",None,None,None,© The Author(s) 2021.

237,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35139517,Evolution of Quality of Life in Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 4-5 Patients Transitioning to Dialysis and Transplantation.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a profound effect on patients' health-related quality of life (QoL). Longitudinal studies on QoL in CKD are scarce and have explored selected patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT). We studied the evolution of QoL in patients with advanced CKD transitioning to dialysis and transplantation in a prospective follow-up study.
A total of 100 participants of the Chronic Arterial Disease, Quality of Life, and Mortality in Chronic Kidney Injury (CADKID) study were enrolled in the study. Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form, biochemistry, and echocardiography were obtained at baseline and after a median interval of 33 (range 12-85) months.
At the time of the follow-up QoL assessment, 32 patients were not receiving RRT, 30 were on hemodialysis (HD), 19 on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 19 had received a kidney transplant. Among kidney transplant recipients (KTRs), ""Burden of Kidney Disease"" and ""General Health"" domains improved compared to patients who initiated HD (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.007, respectively), PD (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.03, respectively), or remained in predialysis care (p = 0.009 and p = 0.003, respectively) while ""Effects of Kidney Disease"" improved compared to those who started HD (p = 0.004) or PD (p = 0.002). The change in Short Form-36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary was not different between patients on different treatment modalities. Higher plasma albumin and cholesterol levels were associated with improved QoL in ""Symptoms/Problems"" (r = 0.28, p = 0.005, and r = 0.30, p = 0.004, respectively) and ""Effects of Kidney Disease"" (r = 0.27, p = 0.008, and r = 0.24, p = 0.03, respectively).

34221384",Sucroferric oxyhydroxide for hyperphosphatemia: a review of real-world evidence.,"Hyperphosphatemia is a common complication in dialysis-dependent patients with chronic kidney disease. Most dialysis-dependent patients need oral phosphate binder therapy to control serum phosphorus concentrations. Most phosphate binders have a high daily pill burden, which may reduce treatment adherence and impair phosphorus control. Sucroferric oxyhydroxide is a potent iron-based phosphate binder approved for use in dialysis-dependent patients in 2013. A randomized controlled trial of sucroferric oxyhydroxide demonstrated its efficacy for reduction of serum phosphorus with a lower pill burden than sevelamer carbonate. Clinical trials carefully select patients, monitor adherence, and routinely titrate medications to a protocol-defined goal. Consequently, trials may not reflect real-world use of medications. Since its approval, we and others have performed retrospective and prospective analyses of sucroferric oxyhydroxide in real-world clinical practice in > 6400 hemodialysis and approximately 500 peritoneal dialysis patients in the USA and Europe. Consistent with the clinical trial data, real-world observational studies have demonstrated that sucroferric oxyhydroxide can effectively reduce serum phosphorus with a lower daily pill burden than most other phosphate binders. These studies have also shown sucroferric oxyhydroxide provides effective serum phosphorus control in different treatment settings, including as monotherapy in phosphate binder-naïve patients, in patients switching from other phosphate binders, or when used in combination with other phosphate binders.

33853800",Measuring patients' experience with renal services in the UK: development and validation of the Kidney PREM.,"Patient experience is a recognized aspect of quality of care for people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but current patient-reported experience measures (PREMs) only focus on dialysis care. We developed and validated the Kidney PREM to assess patients' experience with renal services in secondary care for any CKD stage or treatment (transplant, haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis).
We developed the Kidney PREM in two phases, informed by a multidisciplinary expert group to ensure face validity. We organized three national data collections (2016-8) to investigate item response profiles and to conduct exploratory and confirmatory analyses to assess internal consistency. We also explored content validity in cognitive interviews and evaluated test-retest reliability. Finally, we developed the Kidney PREM Short Form for more frequent measurement of patient experience to inform local service improvements.
We analysed 32 959 responses across data collections, with the 2018 collection covering all 71 UK renal centres. The Kidney PREM final version consisted of 38 items grouped into 13 themes, all pertaining to one underlying dimension reflecting the construct of 'patient experience' with high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.94). The Kidney PREM Short Form consisted of 15 items across the same 13 themes.
The Kidney PREM supports the collection of reliable information on patient experience that people with CKD consider relevant, regardless of CKD stage or treatment modality. Kidney PREM data have the potential to guide local and national initiatives to improve patients' experiences with renal services in the UK and other countries.","['chronic renal insufficiency', 'healthcare surveys', 'patient satisfaction', 'psychometrics']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2022-02-10,"[{'lastname': 'Hawkins', 'firstname': 'Janine', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Services and Clinical Research, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Wellsted', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Services and Clinical Research, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Corps', 'firstname': 'Claire', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Hepatobiliary and Transplant Surgery, St James' University Teaching Hospital, Leeds, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Fluck', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Royal Derby Hospital, Derby, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gair', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'UK Kidney Association, Bristol, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hall', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Services and Clinical Research, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Busby', 'firstname': 'Amanda', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Services and Clinical Research, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Rider', 'firstname': 'Beth', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Services and Clinical Research, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Farrington', 'firstname': 'Ken', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Services and Clinical Research, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK.\nLister Hospital, East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, Stevenage, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharma', 'firstname': 'Shivani', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Services and Clinical Research, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire, Hatfield, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Veer', 'firstname': 'Sabine N', 'initials': 'SN', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Health Informatics, Division of Informatics, Imaging and Data Science, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.'}]",None,None,"We analysed 32 959 responses across data collections, with the 2018 collection covering all 71 UK renal centres.

17443624","Peritoneal dialysis care during the COVID-19 pandemic, Thailand.","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could affect health service provision of less urgent interventions, such as peritoneal dialysis for chronic kidney disease patients.
To assess how peritoneal dialysis centres in Thailand adapted their provision of care, we invited medical directors and peritoneal dialysis managers to respond to an online survey on 1 July 2021. We asked whether they had modified or deferred their training, catheter insertion or removal, intravenous supplements, follow-up and home visits, and workload.
Patients needing dialysis receive peritoneal dialysis free of charge in Thailand. As of 31 December 2020, 240 peritoneal dialysis centres in Thailand have provided care to 32 284 patients.
At 24.6% (29/118) of centres, educational sessions for patients were modified. Catheter insertion continued at 71.9% (82/114) of centres. Few facilities (19.7%; 23/117) continued to perform peritoneal equilibration tests as usual. On-site intravenous injections were mostly transferred to health centres close to the patients' homes. Most centres reduced their outpatient follow-up visits (51.7%; 61/118) and stopped visiting patients at home (66.9%; 79/118). Peritoneal dialysis nurses reported an increased workload at 62.7% (74/118) of centres, and in many instances (66.1%; 78/118) were providing nursing care to COVID-19 patients and administering COVID-19 vaccines.
Health-care providers altered clinical care activities to protect their patients from COVID-19. However, further evidence is needed on the consequences of such alteration in care. To prepare for future pandemics, actors need to explore nonconventional peritoneal dialysis care as well as financial and nonfinancial incentive mechanisms for such care.
La pandémie de maladie à coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) est susceptible d’affecter la réalisation, par les services de santé, d’interventions moins urgentes, telles que les dialyses péritonéales pour les patients atteints de maladies rénales chroniques.
Afin d’évaluer comment les centres médicaux procédant à des dialyses péritonéales en Thaïlande ont adapté leur prestation de soins, nous avons invité des directeurs médicaux et des personnes effectuant des dialyses péritonéales à répondre à une enquête en ligne le 1
En Thaïlande, les patients nécessitant une dialyse bénéficient gratuitement d’une dialyse péritonéale. Au 31 décembre 2020, 240 centres thaïlandais réalisant des dialyses péritonéales ont fourni des prestations à 32 284 patients.
Dans 24,6% (29/118) des centres, les séances éducatives destinées aux patients ont été modifiées. L’insertion de cathéters s’est poursuivie dans 71,9% (82/114) des centres. Peu de centres (19,7%; 23/117) ont continué à effectuer le test d’équilibrage péritonéal comme à leur accoutumée. Les injections intraveineuses sur place ont été transférées pour la plupart dans des centres de santé proches du domicile des patients. La plupart des centres ont réduit leurs visites de suivi ambulatoire (51,7%; 61/118) et ont cessé de rendre visite aux patients à leur domicile (66,9%; 79/118). Le personnel infirmier chargé de réaliser des dialyses péritonéales a signalé une augmentation de sa charge de travail dans 62,7% (74/118) des centres et, dans de nombreux cas (66,1%; 78/118), il fournissait des soins infirmiers aux patients atteints de la COVID-19 et vaccinait contre la COVID-19.
Les prestataires de soins de santé ont modifié leurs activités cliniques pour protéger leurs patients contre la COVID-19. Cependant, des preuves supplémentaires sont nécessaires sur les conséquences d’une telle modification du schéma de soins. Pour se préparer aux futures pandémies, les acteurs de la santé doivent envisager des interventions de dialyse péritonéale non conventionnelles ainsi que des mécanismes d’incitation financière et non financière pour ces soins.

Los proveedores de servicios sanitarios modificaron las actividades de atención clínica para proteger a sus pacientes de la COVID-19.

新型冠状病毒肺炎 (COVID-19) 疫情可能影响不太紧迫的干预措施（例如慢性肾病患者的腹膜透析）的卫生服务供给水平。.
旨在评估泰国腹膜透析中心如何调整其护理服务，我们邀请了医疗主任和腹膜透析负责人来回答一项于 2021 年 7 月 1 日开展的在线调查。我们询问他们是否调整或延迟了培训、导管置入或移除、静脉注射补充治疗、随访和家访以及其它工作任务。.
在泰国，需要透析的患者可以接受免费的腹膜透析。截至 2020 年 12 月 31 日，泰国 240 家腹膜透析中心面向 32,284 位患者提供了护理服务。.
在 24.6% (29/118) 的中心内，面向患者的教育会议进行了调整。71.9% (82/114) 的中心继续提供导管置入服务。少数机构 (19.7%; 23/117) 照常开展腹膜平衡检测。现场静脉注射大多转移到了患者家附近的医疗中心。大多数中心减少了门诊随访 (51.7%; 61/118)，并且停止到患者家中进行访视 (66.9%; 79/118)。腹膜透析护士的报告表明，62.7% (74/118) 的中心工作量增加，在许多情况下 (66.1%; 78/118) 是由于为新型冠状病毒肺炎患者提供护理服务和注射新冠疫苗。.
医疗卫生机构调整临床护理活动以保护其患者免于感染新型冠状病毒肺炎。但是，需要进一步的证据来说明这种护理调整可能产生的后果。为了今后更好地应对疫情，行动者需要探索非常规的腹膜透析护理以及针对这些护理的财务和非财务的激励机制。.
Пандемия коронавирусной инфекции 2019 года (COVID-19) может повлиять на оказание медико-санитарной помощи при состояниях, требующих менее срочных вмешательств, таких как перитонеальный диализ у пациентов с хронической болезнью почек.
Для оценки изменения условий оказания помощи в центрах перитонеального диализа в Таиланде директорам медицинских учреждений и руководителям центров перитонеального диализа было предложено принять участие в электронном опросе мнений, проведенном 1 июля 2021 года. В ходе опроса уточнялось, изменено или отложено их обучение, установка или удаление катетера, добавки к растворам для внутривенного введения, последующее наблюдение и посещения на дому, а также рабочая нагрузка.
Пациенты, нуждающиеся в диализе, получают лечение перитонеальным диализом в Таиланде бесплатно. По состоянию на 31 декабря 2020 года 240 центров перитонеального диализа в Таиланде оказали помощь 32 284 пациентам.
В 24,6% (29/118) центров образовательные занятия для пациентов были изменены. Установка катетеров продолжалась в 71,9% (82/114) центров. В немногих учреждениях (19,7%; 23/117) тест перитонеального равновесия проводился в обычном режиме. Проведение процедур внутривенного введения лекарственных средств на месте в основном переносилось в медицинские центры, расположенные недалеко от домов пациентов. Большинство центров сократили число контрольных посещений (51,7%; 61/118) и перестали посещать пациентов на дому (66,9%; 79/118). Медсестры, проводящие перитонеальный диализ, сообщили о возросшей нагрузке в 62,7% (74/118) центров, и во многих случаях (66,1%; 78/118) они обеспечивали сестринский уход за пациентами с COVID-19 и вводили вакцины против COVID-19.
Поставщики медицинских услуг изменили виды медицинской помощи для защиты пациентов от COVID-19. Однако необходимы дополнительные данные о последствиях такого изменения ухода.

The study was conducted with four patient groups: renal transplantation (TX), stage 3-5 non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD), hemodialysis (HD), and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Laboratory parameters, serum myostatin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 levels were studied. Body composition was estimated using a multifrequency bioimpedance analysis. Handgrip strength (HGS) was evaluated with a handgrip dynamometer. The HGS and appendicular skeletal muscle index measurements were used to determine sarcopenia presence.
The study included 130 patients (72 [55%] male patients). The patient distribution in groups was as follows: 37 in HD, 28 in PD, 37 in renal TX, and 28 in NDD-CKD. The highest level of myostatin was measured in the HD group, and the lowest in the TX group (P < .001). The HGS measurement in the PD group was significantly lower than that in the TX group (P = .025). The myostatin was negatively correlated with HGS, albumin, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and Kt/V

We compared two routinely used total 25-hydroxyvitamin D [t-25(OH)D] methods: a chemiluminescence-immuno-(CLIA) and an electro-chemiluminescence-protein-binding-(ECLPBA) assay.
Two sub-studies were performed: 1) In an ""in vitro"" study, exogenous albumin was added to pools of patients' sera with low albumin levels; and 2) In ""ex vivo"" studies of Cohort_1: sera of hospitalized patients with low albumin levels, and of healthy controls; and of Cohort_2: outpatients with chronic kidney disease in pre-dialysis stage, or on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis were investigated by the routine and LC_MS/MS methods.
When increasing albumin concentrations were ""in vitro"" added, t-25(OH)D levels were overestimated by ECLPBA, and underestimated by CLIA. In patients' sera, positive correlations were detected between t-25(OH)D-vitamin D binding protein (DBP) values by both routine methods, and between t-25(OH)D-albumin values by all three methods. Much higher t-25(OH)D was measured by LC_MS/MS in all subgroups. When altering albumin levels with constant DBP concentration, the ""in vitro"" experiment revealed a higher sensitivity of ECLPBA. The ""ex vivo"" measurements demonstrated clinically relevant differences between the routine methods.
Both routine methods are dependent of the matrix effect in hospitalized patients, which is predicted by the DBP/Albumin ratios.

244,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35115211,Association between serum chloride levels with mortality in incident peritoneal dialysis patients.,"Lower serum chloride (Cl) levels have been associated with excess mortality in pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients. However, the relationship between serum Cl levels and clinical outcomes in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients is unclear.
In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 1656 eligible incident patients undergoing CAPD from 2006 to 2013, and followed until December 2018. Cox regression analyses were used to examine the association between baseline and time-varying serum Cl levels and mortality. During a median follow-up of 46 months, 503 patients (30.4%) died. In analyses of baseline serum Cl, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for tertile 1 (<100.0 mmol/L), tertile 2 (100.0-103.0 mmol/L) versus tertile 3 (>103.0 mmol/L) were 2.34 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.82] and 1.73 (95% CI 1.24-2.42) for all-cause mortality, 2.86 (95% CI 1.47-5.56) and 1.90 (95% CI 1.19-3.02) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, respectively. And a linear relationship was observed between serum Cl and mortality. Further, the inverse association between serum Cl and CVD mortality was particularly accentuated in the patients who were ≥50 years or with a history of diabetes. Similarly, lower time-varying serum Cl levels were also associated with a significant increased risk of all-cause and CVD death.
Lower serum Cl levels predicted higher risk of all-cause and CVD mortality in CAPD patients.","['Cardiovascular disease', 'Mortality', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Serum chloride']","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",2022-02-05,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Hongyu', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China; Key Laboratory of Nephrology, National Health Commission and Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, 510080, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yating', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China; Key Laboratory of Nephrology, National Health Commission and Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, 510080, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Yiping', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China; Key Laboratory of Nephrology, National Health Commission and Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, 510080, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Kefei', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China; Key Laboratory of Nephrology, National Health Commission and Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, 510080, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Xiaohui', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China; Key Laboratory of Nephrology, National Health Commission and Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, 510080, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qiu', 'firstname': 'Yagui', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China; Key Laboratory of Nephrology, National Health Commission and Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, 510080, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Xiao', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China; Key Laboratory of Nephrology, National Health Commission and Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, 510080, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Qinghua', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China; Key Laboratory of Nephrology, National Health Commission and Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, 510080, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Mao', 'firstname': 'Haiping', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, China; Key Laboratory of Nephrology, National Health Commission and Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, 510080, China.

28067806",Association of anemia and iron parameters with mortality among prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients in Taiwan: the AIM-PD study.,"In 1996, the National Health Insurance Administration of Taiwan applied a restrictive reimbursement criteria for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) use in patients with chronic kidney disease. The maximal ESAs dosage allowed by insurance is capped at 20,000 U of epoetin per month. Nephrologists avoided the use of high ESA dosages to achieve a hemoglobin level of 10-11 g/dL using iron supplementation. We assessed the association of anemia and iron parameters with mortality among peritoneal dialysis (AIM-PD) patients. A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on the Taiwan Renal Registry Data System. From January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2008, we enrolled 4356 well-nourished PD patients who were older than 20 years and had been receiving PD for more than 12 months. All patients were divided into subgroups according to different hemoglobin, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) values. Patients were followed until death or December 31, 2008. In a median 2.9-year study period, 694 (15.9%) patients died. By multivariate adjustment, a hemoglobin level lower than 10 g/dL was significantly associated with a higher risk for all-cause and cardiovascular deaths. Moreover, a serum ferritin level higher than 800 ng/mL was associated with a higher risk for all-cause deaths, and a TSAT value between 20 and 50% was associated with the lowest all-cause mortality. In conclusions, we recommend avoiding a low hemoglobin level and a serum ferritin level of more than 800 ng/mL and maintaining a TSAT value between 20 and 50%, as these conditions were associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality in the AIM-PD study.",[],Scientific reports,2022-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Kuo', 'firstname': 'Ko-Lin', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Taipei, Taiwan.\nSchool of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.\nSchool of Post-Baccalaureate Chinese Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Jia-Sin', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Ming-Huang', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Population Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes, 35, Keyan Road, Zhunan Town, Miaoli County, 35053, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hsu', 'firstname': 'Chih-Cheng', 'initials': 'CC', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Population Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes, 35, Keyan Road, Zhunan Town, Miaoli County, 35053, Taiwan. cch@nhri.org.tw.\nDepartment of Health Services Administration, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. cch@nhri.org.tw.\nDepartment of Family Medicine, Min-Sheng General Hospital, Taoyüan, Taiwan. cch@nhri.org.tw.\nInstitute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan. cch@nhri.org.tw.'}, {'lastname': 'Tarng', 'firstname': 'Der-Cherng', 'initials': 'DC', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan. dctarng@vghtpe.gov.tw.\nCenter for Intelligent Drug Systems and Smart Bio-Devices (IDS2B), Hsinchu, Taiwan. dctarng@vghtpe.gov.tw.\nDepartment and Institute of Physiology, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 201, Section 2, Shih-Pai Road, Taipei, 11217, Taiwan. dctarng@vghtpe.gov.tw.\nDivision of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. dctarng@vghtpe.gov.tw.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,© 2022.

22435951",Chronic Kidney Disease Education Class Improves Rates of Early Access Creation and Peritoneal Dialysis Enrollment.,"Background Most patients with end-stage kidney disease begin hemodialysis (HD) in an unplanned fashion at a late stage, necessitating the commencement of HD with a temporary venous catheter, the least favorable option. Alternative modalities of kidney replacement therapy (KRT), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and preemptive transplant offer similar or better outcomes than HD at a lower overall cost, and yet they remain underutilized in Saudi Arabia. Early education may help prepare patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD IV and V) to accept their disease and choose a KRT modality that minimizes complications and matches their lifestyle. The aim of the study is to assess the impact of a pilot educational class on therapy choices and outcomes. Methodology In a cross-sectional study, we conducted phone interviews and reviewed medical records of 81 attendees of the multidisciplinary monthly educational class about KRT that was held at the King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) from January 2017 to October 2021. The interview was conducted at least one year after the participants attended the class. The study proposal, consent, and questionnaire were approved by the King Abdulaziz International Medical Research Center. Patient data was retrieved from KAMC electronic medical record system. Results Volunteer participation in the survey was high (62/81). For the respondents, a preemptive kidney transplant was the most preferred (48/62, 77%) option for KRT. Among the preferred fallback options, HD was the most frequently chosen (29/62, 47%) compared to PD (26/62, 41.9%). At the time of the interview, a great majority of the patients (54/62, 87%) was already on KRT, including about half (26/54, 48%) on HD via a catheter, and the rest about equally divided between those on HD via an arteriovenous (AF) fistula (13/54, 24%) and those on PD (15/54, 28%). Thus, half of the respondents on KRT (28/54, 51%) avoided urgent HD catheter commencement. However, because of an unfortunate shortage of donors, only a small minority (2/62, 3%) of patients received preemptive transplantation. Conclusion The KAMC CKD education class helped boost the fraction of patients, significantly above the national average, who accepted the diagnosis of kidney failure and pursued preemptive native HD access or enrolled in PD.","['educational class', 'end stage renal disease (esrd)', 'general nephrology dialysis and transplanation', 'hemodialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis (pd)', 'renal transplantation']",Cureus,2022-01-25,"[{'lastname': 'Aloudah', 'firstname': 'Saud A', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alanazi', 'firstname': 'Bandar A', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alrehaily', 'firstname': 'Mohammed A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alqessayer', 'firstname': 'Abdulrahman N', 'initials': 'AN', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alanazi', 'firstname': 'Nawaf S', 'initials': 'NS', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Elhassan', 'firstname': 'Elwaleed', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, SAU.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2022, Aloudah et al.",10.7759/cureus.21306,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17f4d1df0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,35070580,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35070580,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan
247,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35060223,The case for increased peritoneal dialysis utilization in low- and lower-middle-income countries.,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has several advantages compared to haemodialysis (HD), but there is evidence showing underutilization globally, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs) where kidney replacement therapies (KRT) are often unavailable, inaccessible, and unaffordable. Only 11% of all dialysis patients worldwide use PD, more than 50% of whom live in China, the United States of America, Mexico, or Thailand. Various barriers to increased PD utilization have been reported worldwide including patient preference, low levels of education, and lower provider reimbursement. However, unique but surmountable barriers are applicable to LLMICs including the excessively high cost of providing PD (related to PD fluids in particular), excessive cost of treatment borne by patients (relative to HD), lack of adequate PD training opportunities for doctors and nurses, low workforce availability for kidney care, and challenges related to some PD outcomes (catheter-related infections, hospitalizations, mortality, etc.). This review discusses some known barriers to PD use in LLMICs and leverages data that show a global trend in reducing rates of PD-related infections, reducing rates of modality switches from HD, and improving patient survival in PD to discuss how PD use can be increased in LLMICs. We therefore, challenge the idea that low PD use in LLMICs is unavoidable due to these barriers and instead present opportunities to improve PD utilization in LLMICs.","['chronic kidney disease', 'cost', 'kidney outcomes', 'kidney replacement therapies', 'low-income and lower-middle-income countries', 'peritoneal dialysis']","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2022-01-22,"[{'lastname': 'Okpechi', 'firstname': 'Ikechi G', 'initials': 'IG', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.\nDivision of Nephrology and Hypertension, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.\nKidney and Hypertension Research Unit, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Jha', 'firstname': 'Vivekanand', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales (UNSW), New Delhi, India.\nSchool of Public Health, Imperial College, London, UK.\nManipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Yeoungjee', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Australasian Kidney Trials Network, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nTranslational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ye', 'firstname': 'Feng', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ijezie', 'firstname': 'Chukwuonye I', 'initials': 'CI', 'affiliation': 'Division of Renal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Umuahia, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Jindal', 'firstname': 'Kailash', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Klarenbach', 'firstname': 'Scott', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Makusidi', 'firstname': 'Muhammad A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Renal Centre, Sokoto, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Okpechi-Samuel', 'firstname': 'Ugochi S', 'initials': 'US', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Federal Medical Centre, Abuja, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Okwuonu', 'firstname': 'Chimezie', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Renal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Umuahia, Nigeria.'}, {'lastname': 'Shah', 'firstname': 'Nikhil', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Thompson', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tonelli', 'firstname': 'Marcello', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'David W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nCentre for Kidney Disease Research, University of Queensland at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bello', 'firstname': 'Aminu K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}]",None,None,None,© 2022 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.,10.1111/nep.14024,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17f4ddcb0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,35060223,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35060223,3.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

29133805",Xanthine oxidoreductase activity in platelet-poor and rich plasma as a oxidative stress indicator in patients required renal replacement therapy.,"Xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) is a hydroxylase enzyme involved in the metabolism of purines. XOR activity can vary: the homodimer protein can be converted into two different isoforms XD (antioxidant) and XO (prooxidant). Oxidative stress and inflammation that accompanying chronic kidney disease (CKD), dialysis, and kidney transplantation, resulted in platelet activation. Present study aimed to determine the influence of applied renal replacement therapy on xanthine oxidoreductase and its isoforms activity.
The study group consisted of 117 patients, divided into 4 groups: hemodialysis - 30 patients, peritoneal dialysis - 30 patients, kidney transplant patients - 27 and conservative treatment - 30 patients. The control group consisted of 30 healthy volunteers.
Significant differences were found in XOR activity in platelet-poor plasma (PPP) within the groups studied (p = 0.001). There was a relationship between the type of renal replacement therapy of all oxidoreductase isoforms in PPP (p < 0.001 all isoforms) and XD (p = 0.008), XO (p < 0.001) in platelet rich-plasma (PRP).

33085443",StatPearls,"The term dialysis is derived from the Greek words dia, meaning ""through,"" and lysis, meaning ""loosening or splitting."" It is a form of renal replacement therapy, where the kidney's role of filtration of the blood is supplemented by artificial equipment, which removes excess water, solutes, and toxins. Dialysis ensures the maintenance of homeostasis (a stable internal environment) in people experiencing a rapid loss of kidney function, i.e., acute kidney injury (AKI) or a prolonged, gradual loss that is chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is a measure to tide over acute kidney injury, buy time until a kidney transplant can be carried out, or sustain those ineligible for it. The incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) depends on the incidence and prevalence of conditions causing end-stage renal disease (ESRD), early diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD), and measures to slow the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Systematic identification of patients with a declining estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), heavy proteinuria, and history of acute kidney injury episodes facilitates planned RRT commencement, thus slowing the rising trend in emergency RRT incidence. All patients likely to end up with ESRD and their caregivers must be adequately prepared physically and psychologically and provided with accessible education about future treatment options. Advanced preparation helps avoid dialysis-associated complications such as a malfunctioning catheter or poorly functioning fistula, causing temporary vascular access insertion culminating in sepsis, thrombosis, bleeding, and accelerated mortality. Patients with educational programs are more likely to choose home-based dialysis therapy with societal benefits, less expenditure, and improved quality of life. These programs should commence no later than stage 4 CKD for the patient to have sufficient time and cognition to make informed choices and implement preparatory measures for RRT. In 2010, approximately 2.5 million people worldwide received chronic RRT, with high absolute rates in North America and maximum prevalence in Taiwan and Japan. Maintenance of regional and national dialysis registries with details on rates, outcomes, and national dialysis practice patterns helps keep track of the population dependent on RRT. They also include hospital-specific information, safety, and quality reporting and provide resources for clinical research. Opting for dialysis is affected by sociocultural and socioeconomic factors. ESRD is disproportionately higher in African Americans and CKD among the White population. ESRD burden is attributed to diabetes mellitus (45%) and hypertension (30%), besides rarer causes like polycystic kidney disease, obstructive nephropathy, and glomerulonephritis. Women are at higher risk for CKD, while men have a higher risk of ESRD. Race disparities can limit access to health care due to their impact on income or the availability of health insurance. Indigenous people in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada have high rates of kidney disease, less access to transplantation, and poorer outcomes. There are three broad types of dialysis: Hemodialysis (HD). Peritoneal dialysis (PD). Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The dynamics of this particular form of renal replacement therapy vary across countries with longer dialysis sessions and slower blood flow rates in Japan. PD is highly prevalent in Hong Kong and the Jalisco region of Mexico, while Home HD is widely adopted in New Zealand and Australia. The timing for initiation of dialysis is decided after considering the complications of early initiation (unnecessary exposure to IV lines and invasive procedure with risks of infection) against late initiation, causing avoidable volume, metabolic, and electrolyte complications of AKI. Assigning arbitrary urea nitrogen or creatinine level for dialysis initiation is not advisable due to individual variability in uremia symptom severity and renal function. Despite optimal CKD management, patients progress to needing RRT, especially when their eGFR drops below 20 ml/ min/1.73 m2 or they rapidly deteriorate to ESRD within 12 months. The eGFR at dialysis initiation has steadily increased in recent times. In 1996, in the United States, 13% of incident ESRD patients started RRT at an eGFR of 10 ml/min/1.73 m2 or higher. This increased to 43% in 2010 and dropped to 39% in 2015. Waiting for uremic symptoms to set in before commencing RRT had added risks of the patient being malnourished with increased mortality risk. Asking patients to compare their current eating habits and physical activity levels with those 6 to 12 months back helps avoid the lack of awareness. The concept of a 'healthy start,' with dialysis commencing before the onset of severe uremia symptoms, is associated with prolonged survival. An early start will prepone the need for a change of modality or further procedures without any improvement in the quality of life while adding to healthcare costs. The Renal Physicians Association's (RPA) criteria for identifying dialysis patients with a poor prognosis beyond 75 years of age includes: 1. Provider's estimation of the likelihood of patient mortality in the next six months. 2. Greatly impaired functional status. 3. High comorbidity score. 4. Severe chronic malnutrition (low serum albumin). Quality of life also strongly predicts mortality. It provides a comprehensive toolkit to encourage shared decision-making. Mortality rates among dialysis patients are markedly higher among younger age groups, primarily attributed to cardiovascular (40%) and infectious causes (10%). High cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients could be related to shared risk factors such as chronic inflammation, significant changes in extracellular volume, dystrophic vascular calcification, and altered cardiovascular dynamics during dialysis. The study of heart and renal protection (SHARP) having dialysis and non-dialysis requiring CKD patients showed a 17% reduction in cardiovascular death and major cardiovascular events with simvastatin-ezetimibe treatment. Cardioprotective strategies such as beta-blockers, aspirin, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors are recommended in dialysis patients based on their cardiovascular risk profile. Hypertension has a graded association with ESRD risk as it is both a cause and a consequence of CKD. The first three months after dialysis initiation, especially among older patients, has the highest mortality rates. This could be due to risks associated with the commencement of dialysis (central venous catheter placement) and more severe comorbidities causing deterioration of renal function. Effective interprofessional collaboration is needed to improve overall outcomes in patients with ESRD requiring dialysis. ",nan,nan,2023,"[{'collective': None, 'lastname': 'Murdeshwar', 'firstname': 'Himani N.', 'initials': 'HN'}, {'collective': None, 'lastname': 'Anjum', 'firstname': 'Fatima', 'initials': 'F'}]",nan,nan,nan,"Copyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",None,nan,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,20581421,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20581421,0.0,nan,eng,Study Guide,"[{'title': 'Continuing Education Activity', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Introduction', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Anatomy and Physiology', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Indications', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Contraindications', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Equipment', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Personnel', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Preparation', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Technique', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Complications', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Clinical Significance', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Review Questions', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'References', 'chapter': None}]",StatPearls Publishing,Treasure Island (FL)

15384025",Abdominal Cocoon: A Rare Complication of Peritoneal Dialysis in Chronic Kidney Disease.,"The abdominal cocoon is a rare clinical entity characterized by a thick fibrocollagenous membrane encasing the intestinal loops. Despite its rarity, the abdominal cocoon is one of the most serious complications of peritoneal dialysis. We report the case of a 45-year-old man, with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis resulting from systemic lupus erythematosus, who presented to the emergency department with progressive abdominal pain for the last two weeks. The pain was associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, and decreased bowel motion. Upon examination, the vital signs were within the normal limits. Abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen with generalized tenderness. There was evidence of ascites as indicated by the positive shifting dullness test. The bowel sounds were of increased frequency and intensity. The laboratory findings were non-contributory. The patient underwent an abdominal computed tomography scan that demonstrated a cluster of small intestinal loops in the middle of the abdomen with a surrounding thick and calcified membrane. This made the diagnosis of the abdominal cocoon. The patient underwent an operation to resect the fibrocollagenous membrane. The patient reported improvement after the operation. No recurrence was noted after three months of follow-up. Abdominal cocoon is a very rare complication of peritoneal dialysis. The diagnosis of abdominal cocoon should be kept in mind when the physician encounters a patient with peritoneal dialysis who presented with non-specific and unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms.","['abdominal cocoon', 'abdominal pain', 'case report', 'end-stage renal disease', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Cureus,2022-01-18,"[{'lastname': 'Mohamed', 'firstname': 'Fatema Y', 'initials': 'FY', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, JOR.'}, {'lastname': 'Alharbi', 'firstname': 'Yasser H', 'initials': 'YH', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Mecca, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Almutairi', 'firstname': 'Mohammad N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Shaqra University, Shaqra, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Azi', 'firstname': 'Nawaf A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, IRL.'}, {'lastname': 'Aljreas', 'firstname': 'Alwaleed A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Shaqra University, Shaqra, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alkhaldi', 'firstname': 'Eman J', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Umm Al-Qura University, Mecca, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alanazi', 'firstname': 'Sulaiman H', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alanazi', 'firstname': 'Abdullah T', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Northern Border University, Arar, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alzahrany', 'firstname': 'Mohammad S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, POL.'}, {'lastname': 'Alali', 'firstname': 'Ahmed A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alharthi', 'firstname': 'Lujain H', 'initials': 'LH', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alkhalifah', 'firstname': 'Rabab K', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Almarhoun', 'firstname': 'Razan M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Alkhadhabah', 'firstname': 'Hajar M', 'initials': 'HM', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, SAU.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Hawaj', 'firstname': 'Faisal', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, SAU.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2021, Mohamed et al.",10.7759/cureus.20341,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17e533240>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,35036184,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35036184,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

We compared the outcomes of COVID-19 in a tertiary care renal hospital among CKD V patients on hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), and dialysis initiation, in terms of duration of hospitalization, in-patient mortality, and 30-day mortality.
A total of 436 CKD V patients, on either HD, PD, or dialysis initiation, with COVID-19 who were admitted at the National Kidney and Transplant Institute (NKTI) from March 13, 2020, to August 31, 2020, were included. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Comparison of probability of mortality by group was performed using Log-Rank test.

28545094",Peritoneal dialysis-first initiative in India: a cost-effectiveness analysis.,"The increasing burden of kidney failure (KF) in India necessitates provision of cost-effective kidney replacement therapy (KRT). We assessed the comparative cost-effectiveness of initiating KRT with peritoneal dialysis (PD) or haemodialysis (HD) in the Indian context.
The cost and clinical effectiveness of starting KRT with either PD or HD were measured in terms of life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using a mathematical Markov model. Complications such as peritonitis, vascular access-related complications and blood-borne infections were considered. Health system costs, out-of-pocket expenditures borne by patients and indirect costs were included. Two scenarios were considered: Scenario 1 (real-world scenario)-as per the current cost and utilization patterns; Scenario 2 (public programme scenario)-use in the public sector as per Pradhan Mantri National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP) guidelines. The lifetime costs and health outcomes among KF patients were assessed.
The mean QALYs lived per KF person with PD and HD were estimated to be 3.3 and 1.6, respectively. From a societal perspective, a PD-first policy is cost-saving as compared with an HD-first policy in both Scenarios 1 and 2. If only the costs directly attributable to patient care (direct costs) are considered, the PD-first treatment policy is estimated to be cost-effective only if the price of PD consumables can be brought down to INR70/U.
PD as initial treatment is a cost-saving option for management of KF in India as compared with HD first. The government should negotiate the price of PD consumables under the PMNDP.","['chronic kidney disease', 'continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis', 'haemodialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Clinical kidney journal,2022-01-18,"[{'lastname': 'Gupta', 'firstname': 'Dharna', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Jyani', 'firstname': 'Gaurav', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramachandran', 'firstname': 'Raja', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Bahuguna', 'firstname': 'Pankaj', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Ameel', 'firstname': 'Mohammed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'National Health Systems Resource Centre, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Dahiya', 'firstname': 'Bharat Bhushan', 'initials': 'BB', 'affiliation': 'National Health Systems Resource Centre, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Kohli', 'firstname': 'Harbir Singh', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Prinja', 'firstname': 'Shankar', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Jha', 'firstname': 'Vivekanand', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'The George Institute of Global Health, New Delhi, India.'}]",None,None,"The mean QALYs lived per KF person with PD and HD were estimated to be 3.3 and 1.6, respectively.

255,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,35015470,[Nutrition and peritoneal dialysis: Fundaments and practical aspects for dietary prescription].,"The number of patients with advanced / end-stage chronic kidney disease (ESRD) with some modality of renal replacement therapy (RRT) has been on the rise significantly. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) represents 11% of the world dialysis population. Different options for RRT have been associated with a greater risk of developing complications, such infections, metabolic alterations and nutritional complications, specifically a higher incidence of protein-energy wasting (PEW), ranging from 32 to 49% in PD patients. Peritoneal transporter type plays an important role in the development of nutritional complications, where the high transporter compared to the slow or low transporter has been associated with a higher nutritional risk by increasing the risk of volume overload, hypertension, and inflammation; as well as greater loss of proteins in the dialysate due to the greater number of replacements that characterize its prescription. Nutrition specialists needs to consider diverse aspects to achieve an individualized nutritional approach based on the characteristics of the patient, where knowing peritoneal transporter type is essential. The aim of this study is to review the evidence available to date regarding nutritional therapy in patients with peritoneal dialysis, as well as to analyze some basic aspects of dialysis therapy.
El número de pacientes con enfermedad renal crónica avanzada/terminal (ERCT) con alguna modalidad de terapia de reemplazo renal (TRR) ha ido en ascenso. A nivel mundial, la diálisis peritoneal (DP) representa el 11% del total de pacientes con TRR. Las diferentes opciones de TRR se han asociado con un mayor riesgo para desarrollar complicaciones infecciosas, metabólicas y nutricionales, reportándose cifras alarmantes de desgaste proteico energético (DPE) que oscilan entre 32-49% en pacientes en DP. El tipo de transportador peritoneal juega un rol importante en el desarrollo de complicaciones nutricionales, donde el transportador alto, en comparación con el lento o bajo, se ha asociado con un mayor riesgo nutricional al incrementar el riesgo de sobrecarga de volumen, hipertensión e inflamación; así como mayor pérdida de proteínas en el dializado por el mayor número de recambios que caracteriza su prescripción. Por tal motivo, el profesional de la nutrición debe considerar diversos aspectos para lograr un abordaje nutricional individualizado a partir de las características del paciente, en el que conocer el tipo de transportador peritoneal es fundamental. El objetivo del presente trabajo es realizar una revisión de la evidencia disponible hasta la fecha respecto a la terapia nutricional del paciente con diálisis peritoneal, así como analizar algunos aspectos básicos de la terapia dialítica.","['Diet', 'Malnutrition', 'Nutrition Therapy', 'Peritoneal Dialysis']",Revista medica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social,2022-01-12,"[{'lastname': 'Leal-Escobar', 'firstname': 'Gabriela', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Secretaría de Salud, Instituto Nacional de Cardiología Ignacio Chávez, Departamento de Nefrología.

30742721",Epidemiology and burden of chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus.,"Chronic kidney disease-associated pruritus (CKD-aP) is a common, yet underrecognized condition in patients with CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Real-world observational studies indicate that CKD-aP affects up to 80% of ESKD patients undergoing haemodialysis (HD), with ∼40% experiencing moderate to severe itch. CKD-aP can negatively impact patients' mental and physical health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and is also associated with sleep disturbance and depression. Several studies have found that CKD-aP is a predictor of adverse medical outcomes, including an increased risk of hospitalizations and mortality. In this article we review the literature relating to the epidemiology of CKD-aP to describe its prevalence across the treatment spectrum of CKD (non-dialysis, HD, peritoneal dialysis and transplant recipients) and to summarize potential risk factors associated with its development. We also review key data from studies that have evaluated the impact of CKD-aP on HRQoL and medical outcomes.","['chronic kidney disease', 'end-stage kidney disease', 'itch', 'quality of life', 'uraemic pruritus']",Clinical kidney journal,2022-01-07,"[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Dana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Pollock', 'firstname': 'Carol', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.'}]",None,None,None,© The Author(s) 2021.

This study explores the experiences and perceptions of rural and remote patients and families in relation to accessing health services for kidney disease in Aotearoa New Zealand.
We conducted an In-depth interview study. We purposively sampled adult patients with CKD and their caregivers who lived further than 100 km (62 miles) or more than 1 h drive from their nearest dialysis or transplant centre. Qualitative data were analyzed inductively to generate themes, subthemes and a conceptual framework.
Of 35 participants, including 26 patients and nine caregivers, 51% were female, 71% travelled between 1 and 3 h to their nearest renal unit, and the remainder, between 3 and 6 h. We identified five themes and related subthemes: intense psychological impact of rurality; pressure of extended periods away from home; services not designed for rural and remote living; suffering from financial losses; and poor communication.
Rural and remote patients with CKD and their caregivers face the added challenges of separation from family, social and community support and financial burden, which can have profound consequences on their psychological and physical well-being and that of their families.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'end-stage kidney disease', 'haemodialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis']","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2022-01-06,"[{'lastname': 'Walker', 'firstname': 'Rachael C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': ""Research Innovation Centre, Eastern Institute of Technology, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand.""}, {'lastname': 'Hay', 'firstname': 'Sandra', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Walker', 'firstname': 'Curtis', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Midcentral District Health Board, Palmerston North, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Tipene-Leach', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Research Innovation Centre, Eastern Institute of Technology, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand.""}, {'lastname': 'Palmer', 'firstname': 'Suetonia C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Canterbury District Health Board, Christchurch, New Zealand.\nDepartment of Medicine, University of Otago Christchurch, Christchurch, New Zealand.'}]",None,"Rural and remote patients with CKD and their caregivers face the added challenges of separation from family, social and community support and financial burden, which can have profound consequences on their psychological and physical well-being and that of their families.","Of 35 participants, including 26 patients and nine caregivers, 51% were female, 71% travelled between 1 and 3 h to their nearest renal unit, and the remainder, between 3 and 6 h.

18586764",Evaluating a shared decision-making intervention regarding dialysis modality: development and validation of self-assessment items for patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Shared decision-making is a two-way symmetrical communication process in which clinicians and patients work together to achieve the best outcome. This study aimed to develop self-assessment items as a decision aid for choosing a dialysis modality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and to assess the construct validity of the newly developed items.
Five focus group interviews were performed to extract specific self-assessment items regarding patient values in choosing a dialysis modality. After survey items were refined, a survey of 330 patients, consisting of 152 hemodialysis (HD) and 178 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, was performed to validate the self-assessment items.
The self-assessment for the decision aid was refined to 35 items. The structure of the final items appeared to have three dimensions of factors; health, lifestyle, and dialysis environment. The health factor consisted of 12 subscales (α = 0.724), the lifestyle factor contained 11 subscales (α = 0.624), and the dialysis environment factor was represented by 12 subscales (α = 0.694). A structural equation model analysis showed that the relationship between the decision aid factors (health, lifestyle, and dialysis environment), patients' CKD perception, and cognition of shared decision-making differed between HD patients and PD patients.
We developed and validated self-assessment items as part of a decision aid to help patients with CKD. This attempt may assist CKD patients in making informed and shared decisions closely aligned with their values when considering dialysis modality.","['Decision support techniques', 'Perception', 'Self-assessment', 'Shared decision-making']",Kidney research and clinical practice,2022-01-03,"[{'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Soojin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Communication and Media, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Park', 'firstname': 'Jung Tak', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Kidney Disease Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Sung Joon', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital, Goyang, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Jae Hyun', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Gil Medical Center, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoo', 'firstname': 'Kyung Don', 'initials': 'KD', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Ulsan University Hospital, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jung Pyo', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Ryu', 'firstname': 'Dong-Ryeol', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'An', 'firstname': 'Soontae', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Communication and Media, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Sejoong', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea.'}]",None,We developed and validated self-assessment items as part of a decision aid to help patients with CKD.

Patients across the spectrum of kidney disease should be screened for depression every 6 to 12 months using self-report questionnaires, followed by an interview with a clinician to confirm the presence of sadness or anhedonia when depressive symptoms are identified. Pharmacologic treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has not consistently shown benefit compared with placebo and may be associated with serious adverse outcomes including cardiovascular events, bleeding, and fractures. However, based on the availability of alternative therapies, a watchful trial with close monitoring for therapeutic and adverse effects is reasonable. Several clinical trials have suggested that cognitive behavioral therapy and physical activity improve depressive symptoms when compared with a control group. Given the low risk associated with these therapies, they should be recommended to patients who have access and are amenable to such interventions.

29049991",Evaluating Self-Efficacy among Patients Undergoing Dialysis Therapy.,"(1) Background: Perceived disease-related self-efficacy is considered a fundamental component of the successful self-management of chronic diseases. Prior studies have found that self-efficacy is associated with improvements in health behaviors and health status among people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, few studies have evaluated self-efficacy among patients undergoing dialysis. (2) Methods: This study was performed to evaluate CKD patients' self-efficacy and to determine the factors that significantly affect self-efficacy among dialysis patients. This was a cross-sectional study using a convenience sample of 190 patients undergoing dialysis. The patients' self-efficacy was measured using the CKD Self-Efficacy Scale. Inferential statistics were used to analyze the data. (3) Results: The mean age of the participants was 49.24 ± 13.15 years. Almost half of them were males (48.4%), and 75.3% were married. The majority of the patients (83%) were undergoing hemodialysis. The total score for self-efficacy was 192.57 ± 39.23. Only occupational status and the type of dialysis were significantly and positively correlated with patients' perceived self-efficacy scores. (4) Conclusions: This study provides primary evidence of the perceived self-efficacy among CKD patients who are on dialysis. The results of this cross-sectional study showed that greater self-efficacy was associated with employment and peritoneal dialysis. Strategies to enhance self-efficacy among dialysis patients, especially those on hemodialysis, are needed.","['chronic kidney disease', 'hemodialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'self-efficacy']","Nursing reports (Pavia, Italy)",2021-12-31,"[{'lastname': 'Almutary', 'firstname': 'Hayfa', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Medical/Surgical Nursing Department, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.\nMedical/Surgical Department, Faculty of Nursing, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tayyib', 'firstname': 'Nahla', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Nursing Practice Department, College of Nursing, Umm Al-Qura University, Alalziziah Makkah 77207, Saudi Arabia.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/nursrep11010019

24857322",Assessment of Alveolar Bone and Periodontal Status in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 8-13% of the global population and has become one of the largest burdens on healthcare systems around the world. Peritoneal dialysis is one of the ultimate treatments for patients with severe CKD. Recently, increasing severe periodontal problems have been found in CKD patients. Periodontitis has been identified as a new variable risk factor for CKD. The aim of this study was to investigate the periodontal status and severity of alveolar bone loss in CKD patients with peritoneal dialysis (PD). One hundred and six patients undergoing PD (PD group) and 97 systemically healthy periodontitis patients (control group) were enrolled. The differences in the dimensions of the alveolar bone between two groups were compared, and the distribution of alveolar bone defects was analyzed by cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). Gingival index (GI), plaque index (PLI), periodontal probing depth (PPD), and attachment loss (AL) were recorded. The levels of inflammatory factors in gingival crevicular fluid were assessed by ELISA. Compared to control group, there was a higher degree of alveolar bone loss in maxillary premolars, maxillary 2nd molar and mandibular 1st molar in patients with PD (","['alveolar bone', 'chronic kidney disease', 'cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)', 'periodontal status', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Frontiers in physiology,2021-12-31,"[{'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Kristine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Department of Periodontology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, National Center for Stomatology, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Hui', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Department of Periodontology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, National Center for Stomatology, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Yingli', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Deng', 'firstname': 'Hai', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Huiwen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ""Department of Periodontology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, National Center for Stomatology, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Zhongchen', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""Department of Periodontology, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, College of Stomatology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, National Center for Stomatology, National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Shanghai Key Laboratory of Stomatology, Shanghai, China.""}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2021 Sun, Shen, Liu, Deng, Chen and Song.","10.3389/fphys.2021.759056

263,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34957720,[RENAL TUBULAR DYSGENESIS SECONDARY TO MUTATIONS IN GENES ENCODING THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM].,"Autosomal recessive renal tubular dysgenesis (RTD;OMIM: 267430) is a rare kidney disease secondary to mutations in genes encoding the renin-angiotensin system which have a role in renal tissue development during fetal life and in the maintenance of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The disease is characterized by oligohydramnios, prematurity, neonatal renal failure, hypotension and abnormalities in cranial bone development. Nearly all affected individuals die either in-utero or within the first few days of life, although a few long term survivors were reported during the last decade. We describe the management of 5 newborns diagnosed with RTD in pregnancy who survived the neonatal period, four of them belong to an extended Bedouin family. In 4/5 patients we identified a mutation in angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene. Variable presentation was noticed in the patients, starting with peritoneal dialysis and extreme low blood pressure treated with vasopressors and plasma infusions and ending with no symptoms. Currently, the patients are 5-20 years old with variable stages of chronic kidney disease. In conclusion, the spectrum of RTD is wider than previously reported. Prompt diagnosis is necessary for optimal decision-making by families and physicians. Intensive treatment of low blood pressure in the postnatal period is critical for their survival and better prognosis.",[],Harefuah,2021-12-28,"[{'lastname': 'Schreiber', 'firstname': 'Ruth', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Saban Pediatric Medical Center, Soroka University Medical Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Dolgin', 'firstname': 'Vadim', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'The Morris Kahn Laboratory of Human Genetics, Soroka University Medical Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Landau', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Schneider Children's Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Petah Tikva, Israel.""}, {'lastname': 'Gurevich', 'firstname': 'Evgenia', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Schneider Children's Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Petah Tikva, Israel.""}, {'lastname': 'Shalev', 'firstname': 'Hanna', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Saban Pediatric Medical Center, Soroka University Medical Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Geylis', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Saban Pediatric Medical Center, Soroka University Medical Center, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.'}]",None,None,None,None,None,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17f7205e0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,34957720,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34957720,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

28316276",Trends in Adaptive Design Methods in Dialysis Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review.,"Adaptive design methods are intended to improve the efficiency of clinical trials and are relevant to evaluating interventions in dialysis populations. We sought to determine the use of adaptive designs in dialysis clinical trials and quantify trends in their use over time.
We completed a novel full-text systematic review that used a machine learning classifier (RobotSearch) for filtering randomized controlled trials and adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.
We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) and ClinicalTrials.gov using sensitive dialysis search terms.
We included all randomized clinical trials with patients receiving dialysis or clinical trials with dialysis as a primary or secondary outcome. There was no restriction of disease type or intervention type.
We performed a detailed data extraction of trial characteristics and a completed a narrative synthesis of the data.
57 studies, available as 68 articles and 7 ClinicalTrials.gov summaries, were included after full-text review (initial search, 209,033 PubMed abstracts and 6,002 ClinicalTrials.gov summaries). 31 studies were conducted in a dialysis population and 26 studies included dialysis as a primary or secondary outcome. Although the absolute number of adaptive design methods is increasing over time, the relative use of adaptive design methods in dialysis trials is decreasing over time (6.12% in 2009 to 0.43% in 2019, with a mean of 1.82%). Group sequential designs were the most common type of adaptive design method used. Adaptive design methods affected the conduct of 50.9% of trials, most commonly resulting in stopping early for futility (41.2%) and early stopping for safety (23.5%). Acute kidney injury was studied in 32 trials (56.1%), kidney failure requiring dialysis was studied in 24 trials (42.1%), and chronic kidney disease was studied in 1 trial (1.75%). 27 studies (47.4%) were supported by public funding. 44 studies (77.2%) did not report their adaptive design method in the title or abstract and would not be detected by a standard systematic review.
We limited our search to 2 databases (PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov) due to the scale of studies sourced (209,033 and 6,002 results, respectively).
Adaptive design methods are used in dialysis trials but there has been a decline in their relative use over time.","['Dialysis', 'adaptive design', 'end stage kidney disease', 'hemodialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Kidney medicine,2021-12-24,"[{'lastname': 'Judge', 'firstname': 'Conor', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'HRB-Clinical Research Facility Galway, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland.\nTranslational Medical Device Lab, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland.\nWellcome Trust-HRB, Irish Clinical Academic Training, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Murphy', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'HRB-Clinical Research Facility Galway, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Reddin', 'firstname': 'Catriona', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'HRB-Clinical Research Facility Galway, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland.\nWellcome Trust-HRB, Irish Clinical Academic Training, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Cormican', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'HRB-Clinical Research Facility Galway, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland.\nWellcome Trust-HRB, Irish Clinical Academic Training, Dublin, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Smyth', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'HRB-Clinical Research Facility Galway, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Halloran"", 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Translational Medical Device Lab, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Donnell"", 'firstname': 'Martin J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'HRB-Clinical Research Facility Galway, NUI Galway, Galway, Ireland.'}]",None,None,"57 studies, available as 68 articles and 7 ClinicalTrials.gov summaries, were included after full-text review (initial search, 209,033 PubMed abstracts and 6,002 ClinicalTrials.gov summaries). 31 studies were conducted in a dialysis population and 26 studies included dialysis as a primary or secondary outcome.

32100204","Dysnatremias in Chronic Kidney Disease: Pathophysiology, Manifestations, and Treatment.","The decreased ability of the kidney to regulate water and monovalent cation excretion predisposes patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to dysnatremias. In this report, we describe the clinical associations and methods of management of dysnatremias in this patient population by reviewing publications on hyponatremia and hypernatremia in patients with CKD not on dialysis, and those on maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The prevalence of both hyponatremia and hypernatremia has been reported to be higher in patients with CKD than in the general population. Certain features of the studies analyzed, such as variation in the cut-off values of serum sodium concentration ([Na]) that define hyponatremia or hypernatremia, create comparison difficulties. Dysnatremias in patients with CKD are associated with adverse clinical conditions and mortality. Currently, investigation and treatment of dysnatremias in patients with CKD should follow clinical judgment and the guidelines for the general population. Whether azotemia allows different rates of correction of [Na] in patients with hyponatremic CKD and the methodology and outcomes of treatment of dysnatremias by renal replacement methods require further investigation. In conclusion, dysnatremias occur frequently and are associated with various comorbidities and mortality in patients with CKD. Knowledge gaps in their treatment and prevention call for further studies.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dysnatremia', 'hemodialysis', 'hypernatremia', 'hyponatremia', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Frontiers in medicine,2021-12-24,"[{'lastname': 'Arzhan', 'firstname': 'Soraya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Lew', 'firstname': 'Susie Q', 'initials': 'SQ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, George Washington University, Washington, DC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Ing', 'firstname': 'Todd S', 'initials': 'TS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Tzamaloukas', 'firstname': 'Antonios H', 'initials': 'AH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Albuquerque, NM, United States.\nResearch Service, Raymond G.

30169229",Chronic peritoneal dialysis in children with chronic kidney disease: An experience from a North Indian teaching institute.,"Chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) is an important modality of renal replacement therapy (RRT) in children of all ages with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We retrospectively assessed the clinical profile of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) initiated on CPD at a tertiary care centre in Northern India.
Retrospective data of 13 children with CKD and initiated on CPD between 2016 and 2019 were retrieved and analysed. The demographic and clinical profile, aetiology of CKD, method of catheter insertion, mode of dialysis, complications, and catheter survival rate were analysed.
The median age at the onset of the symptoms was 81 months interquartile range (IQR 11-90) and the median age at the diagnosis was 81 months (IQR 36-103). The median age at the initiation of CPD was 92.97 months (IQR 74.43-108.79). The median serum creatinine at the initiation of CPD was 6.3 mg/dL (IQR 4.25-8.4). During a total study period of 84 CPD months, we observed 16 catheter-related complications and a complication rate of 1 per 5.25 CPD months. The overall peritonitis rate was 1 episode per 13.66 patient-months (0.87 episodes per patient-year). The catheter displacement/migration was seen in 23% of the cases. The median duration of follow-up was 175 days (IQR 85-249) with the longest follow-up duration of 502 days.
CPD is the modality of choice for smaller children with ESRD as venous access is difficult to achieve in smaller children. Complications especially related to infections are a major concern in addition to poor growth associated with ESRD.","['Children', 'chronic kidney disease', 'chronic peritoneal dialysis', 'peritonitis']",Journal of family medicine and primary care,2021-12-23,"[{'lastname': 'Tiewsoh', 'firstname': 'Karalanglin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Soni', 'firstname': 'Akshita', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Dawman', 'firstname': 'Lesa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Peters', 'firstname': 'Nitin J', 'initials': 'NJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Malik', 'firstname': 'Muneer A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Surgery, Advanced Pediatrics Centre, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.'}]",None,CPD is the modality of choice for smaller children with ESRD as venous access is difficult to achieve in smaller children.

267,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34931556,Neobladder creation is still a conduit to peritoneal dialysis - Successful use of peritoneal dialysis after invasive bladder cancer.,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is as safe and more cost-effective than haemodialysis (HD). It also allows patients to undergo renal replacement therapy (RRT) from home. However, PD remains underutilised in many parts of the world. This is true in part because of many perceived relative contraindications to PD, including a history of prior major abdominal surgery. Prior major abdominal surgery is a concern for standard bedside or surgical catheter placement since these patients are at risk of having adhesions, which can complicate catheter placement. However, with laparoscopic advancements, prior major abdominal surgery is no longer even a relative contraindication to PD for skilled and experienced surgeons. We report the case of a male in his 70s with a history of cystoprostatectomy which was curative for a muscle invasive bladder carcinoma 5 years prior to his RRT. The patient had longstanding chronic kidney disease which worsened gradually. After receiving RRT education, the patient favoured PD. The catheter was placed despite the surgeon noting abdominal adhesions and the patient successfully underwent 12 months of PD which had a positive impact on his quality of life. He transferred to HD after contracting a complex PD-associated peritonitis. Thus, new research should be conducted to better understand the real impact of prior abdominal surgeries as a contraindication to PD, especially in centres where the surgeons have experience with advanced laparoscopy.","['Peritoneal dialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis after neobladder creation', 'peritoneal dialysis with prior abdominal surgery', 'relative contraindication to peritoneal dialysis']",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,2021-12-22,"[{'lastname': 'Cosmatos', 'firstname': 'Alexandre', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'McCormick', 'firstname': 'Brendan', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nKidney Research Centre, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Pierre Antoine', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nKidney Research Centre, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}]",None,None,None,None,10.1177/08968608211065882,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17f6e8360>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,34931556,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34931556,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

This study was aimed to demonstrate efficacy and safety under the evidence-based approach.
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of rHuEPO (Hema-Plus) for treatment of anemia over 12 wk in Thai patients with Stage V chronic kidney disease (CKD) on peritoneal dialysis (PD).
This study was an open-label, multi-center study to enroll 30 CKD patients identified to start PD with hemoglobin (Hb) less than 9.5 g/dL, serum ferritin more than 100 ng/mL, serum transferrin saturation more than or equal to 20% and who had not previously received epoetin. Patients with conditions that could increase the risk of adverse effects from study participation or interfere with study outcomes, were using concomitant androgens or had secondary hyperparathyroidism were excluded. All eligible patients started Hema-Plus by SC injection at 4000 IU once or twice weekly (week 0) and with follow-up at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. Dosage adjustment could be done to achieve Hb level of 11-12 g/dL. Primary end point was mean change in Hb level from baseline to end of treatment (week 12). Safety was assessed throughout the study. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using KDQOL-36.
All 30 enrolled patients completed the study. Mean (standard deviation) Hb at baseline (week 0) to the end of 12 wk was significantly increased from 7.39 (1.29) g/dL to 11.15 (1.73) g/dL (paired

33668249",Volume-Independent Sodium Toxicity in Peritoneal Dialysis: New Insights from Bench to Bed.,"Sodium overload is common in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality that is traditionally considered a result of extracellular volume expansion. Recently, sodium storage was detected by Na23 magnetic resonance imaging in the interstitial tissue of the skin and other tissues. This amount of sodium is osmotically active, regulated by immune cells and the lymphatic system, escapes renal control, and, more importantly, is associated with salt-sensitive hypertension. In chronic kidney disease, the interstitial sodium storage increases as the glomerular filtration rate declines and is related to cardiovascular damage, regardless of the fluid overload. This sodium accumulation in the interstitial tissues becomes more significant in ESKD, especially in older and African American patients. The possible negative effects of interstitial sodium are still under study, though a higher sodium intake might induce abnormal structural and functional changes in the peritoneal wall. Interestingly, sodium stored in the interstial tissue is not unmodifiable, since it is removable by dialysis. Nevertheless, the sodium removal by peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains challenging, and new PD solutions are desirable. In this narrative review, we carried out an update on the pathophysiological mechanisms of volume-independent sodium toxicity and possible future strategies to improve sodium removal by PD.","['end-stage kidney disease', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'sodium']",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-12-11,"[{'lastname': 'Borrelli', 'firstname': 'Silvio', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Nephrology, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'De Nicola', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Nephrology, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'De Gregorio', 'firstname': 'Ilaria', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Nephrology, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Polese', 'firstname': 'Lucio', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Nephrology, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Pennino', 'firstname': 'Luigi', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Nephrology, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Elefante', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Nephrology, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Carbone', 'firstname': 'Alessandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Nephrology, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rappa', 'firstname': 'Tiziana', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Nephrology, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Minutolo', 'firstname': 'Roberto', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Nephrology, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Garofalo', 'firstname': 'Carlo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Unit of Nephrology, Department of Advanced Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", 80138 Naples, Italy.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/ijms222312804

34109128",The Effect of Statins in Cancer Risk Reduction in Patients on Dialysis: A Population-Based Case-Control Study.,"To realize whether statins reduce the risk of cancer in susceptible dialysis populations, this study analyzed the relationship between statin use and cancer risk in patients on dialysis.
Patients having a history of chronic kidney disease with hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and receiving statin prescriptions or not were enrolled. The main outcome was cancer diagnosis. This study used univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses.
In total, 4236 individuals in the statin group and 8472 individuals in the statin nonuser group were included in the study. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that statin users are significantly less likely to develop cancer than statin nonusers (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78-0.90). Subgroup analyses revealed that statin cumulative defined daily doses >365 were associated with a significantly decreased risk of cancer incidence (adjusted HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45-0.87), and statin users have a reduced risk of respiratory, soft tissue and connective tissue, breast, gynecological, prostate, central nervous system, and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer than nonusers.
Our population-based cohort study provides an association that statins reduce the risk of malignancy in patients on dialysis, especially with a longer treatment duration, and certain types of cancer.","['cancer risk', 'chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'statin']",Journal of clinical medicine,2021-12-11,"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Po-Huang', 'initials': 'PH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Jhou', 'firstname': 'Hong-Jie', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua City 500, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chung', 'firstname': 'Chi-Hsiang', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Medical Research, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.\nTaiwanese Injury Prevention and Safety Promotion Association, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Cho-Hao', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Division of Hematology and Oncology Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Yi-Ying', 'initials': 'YY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Hematology and Oncology Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Wei-Chou', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chien', 'firstname': 'Wu-Chien', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Medical Research, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.\nGraduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Ping-Ying', 'initials': 'PY', 'affiliation': 'Division of Hematology and Oncology Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei City 11490, Taiwan.'}]",None,None,"In total, 4236 individuals in the statin group and 8472 individuals in the statin nonuser group were included in the study.

10911649","Current clinical practice in adapted automated peritoneal dialysis (aAPD)-A prospective, non-interventional study.","Adapted automated peritoneal dialysis (aAPD), comprising a sequence of dwells with different durations and fill volumes, has been shown to enhance both ultrafiltration and solute clearance compared to standard peritoneal dialysis with constant time and volume dwells. The aim of this non-interventional study was to describe the different prescription patterns used in aAPD in clinical practice and to observe outcomes characterizing volume status, dialysis efficiency, and residual renal function over 1 year. Prevalent and incident, adult aAPD patients were recruited during routine clinic visits, and aAPD prescription, volume status, residual renal function and laboratory data were documented at baseline and every quarter thereafter for 1 year. Treatments were prescribed according to the nephrologist's medical judgement in accordance with each center's clinical routine. Of 180 recruited patients, 160 were analyzed. 27 different aAPD prescription patterns were identified. 79 patients (49.4%) received 2 small, short dwells followed by 3 long, large dwells. During follow-up, volume status changed only marginally, with visit mean values ranging between 1.59 (95% confidence interval: 1.19; 1.99) and 1.97 (1.33; 2.61) L. Urine output and creatinine clearance decreased significantly, accompanied by reductions in ultrafiltration and Kt/V. 25 patients (15.6%) received a renal transplant and 15 (9.4%) were changed to hemodialysis. Options for individualization offered by aAPD are actually used in practice for optimized treatment. Changes observed in renal function and dialysis efficiency measures reflect the natural course of chronic kidney disease. No safety events were observed during the study period.",[],PloS one,2021-12-10,"[{'lastname': 'Vera', 'firstname': 'Manel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheak', 'firstname': 'Bee Boon', 'initials': 'BB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Selayang, Selangor, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chmelíčková', 'firstname': 'Hana', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Hospital Trebic, Trebic, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Bavanandan', 'firstname': 'Sunita', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Goh', 'firstname': 'Bak Leong', 'initials': 'BL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology & Clinical Research Centre, Hospital Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Abdul Halim', 'firstname': 'Abdul Gafor', 'initials': 'AG', 'affiliation': 'Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia', 'firstname': 'Isabel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Hospital Universitario di Girona Josep Trueta, Girona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gajdoš', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, NC Centre Sokolov, Sokolov, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Alonso Valente', 'firstname': 'Rafael', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology, Complejo Hospital Universitario de Santiago, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'De Los Ríos', 'firstname': 'Tatiana', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office, Bad Homburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Atiye', 'firstname': 'Saynab', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office, Bad Homburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Stauss-Grabo', 'firstname': 'Manuela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Fresenius Medical Care, Global Medical Office, Bad Homburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Galli', 'firstname': 'Emilio', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Nefrologia e dialisi, ASST Bergamo Ovest, Treviglio, Italy.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.1371/journal.pone.0258440

33240136",Psychological distress of patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing dialysis during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic: A cross-sectional study in a University Hospital.,"Previous studies have revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic can cause psychological distress such as depression and anxiety. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) might be more vulnerable to psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its impact could be different according to dialysis modality. The aim of this study was to investigate COVID-19-related psychological stress experienced by end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients and identify differences in concerns about COVID-19 between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
This cross-sectional study included 148 dialysis patients at Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital from August 2020 to September 2020. These patients responded to a questionnaire covering mental health status and COVID-19 related concerns. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia were measured using a 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, a 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and a 7-item Insomnia severity Index (ISI), respectively. Outcomes of HD and PD patients were compared by propensity score matching analysis.
Dialysis patients reported psychological distress including symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and insomnia. HD patients showed higher scores for depression (p = 0.018), anxiety(p = 0.005), stress(p<0.001), and insomnia(p = 0.006) than the PD patients. After propensity score matching, HD was associated with depression(p = 0.0131), anxiety(p = 0.0143), and stress(p = 0.000415).

This results in necrotic, ischemic, tender dermal lesions anywhere in the body, but mainly on the abdominal wall and lower extremities, where subcutaneous tissue is abundant. Histologically, it is defined by calcification in dermal capillaries, arterioles, and subcutaneous adipose tissues. It can occur in all advanced stages of chronic kidney disease as well as end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Our case highlights a successful case of calciphylaxis in a young female patient who underwent parathyroidectomy and intensification of peritoneal dialysis regimen along with the infusion of sodium thiosulphate injection resulting in complete resolution of the lesion in 3 months. With limited evidence of treatment options and increased frequency of this condition in a dialysis patient, our case highlights the key aspects of calciphylaxis management in a young end-stage renal disease patient who didn't need a change of dialysis modality. We also review the risk factors and current practiced management options of this condition in our article.","['calciphylaxis', 'end stage renal disease', 'parathyroidectomy', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'sodium thiosulphate']",Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports,2021-12-01,"[{'lastname': 'Roy', 'firstname': 'Sasmit', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Virginia, Charlottesville, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Reddy', 'firstname': 'Sohil Narasimha', 'initials': 'SN', 'affiliation': 'The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcha', 'firstname': 'Amarinder Singh', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Kaweah Delta Medical Center, Visalia, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vantipalli', 'firstname': 'Praveena', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'University of Nebraska Omaha, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Sumit S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'Adventis Health, Hanford, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ur Rahman', 'firstname': 'Ebad', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""St. Mary's Medical Center, Huntington, WV, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Adapa', 'firstname': 'Sreedhar', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Kaweah Delta Medical Center, Visalia, CA, USA.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.1177/23247096211060580

277,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34818248,Progression of Aortic Calcification in Stage 4-5 Chronic Kidney Disease Patients Transitioning to Dialysis and Transplantation.,"Abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and associated with increased mortality. Comparative data on the AAC score progression in CKD patients transitioning from conservative treatment to different modalities of renal replacement therapy (RRT) are lacking and were examined.
150 study patients underwent lateral lumbar radiograph to study AAC in the beginning of the study before commencing RRT (AAC1) and at 3 years of follow-up (AAC2). We examined the associations between repeated laboratory tests taken every 3 months, echocardiographic and clinical variables and AAC increment per year (ΔAAC), and the association between ΔAAC and outcomes during follow-up.
At the time of AAC2 measurement, 39 patients were on hemodialysis, 39 on peritoneal dialysis, 39 had a transplant, and 33 were on conservative treatment. Median AAC1 was 4.8 (0.5-9.0) and median AAC2 8.0 (1.5-12.0) (p < 0.0001). ΔAAC was similar across the treatment groups (p = 0.19). ΔAAC was independently associated with mean left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (log LVMI: β = 0.97, p = 0.02) and mean phosphorus through follow-up (log phosphorus: β = 1.19, p = 0.02) in the multivariable model. Time to transplantation was associated with ΔAAC in transplant recipients (per month on the waiting list: β = 0.04, p = 0.001). ΔAAC was associated with mortality (HR 1.427, 95% confidence interval 1.044-1.950, p = 0.03).
AAC progresses rapidly in patients with CKD, and ΔAAC is similar across the CKD treatment groups including transplant recipients. The increment rate is associated with mortality and in transplant recipients with the time on the transplant waiting list.","['Aortic calcification', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Chronic kidney disease']",Kidney & blood pressure research,2021-11-25,"[{'lastname': 'Lankinen', 'firstname': 'Roosa', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Centre, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hakamäki', 'firstname': 'Markus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Centre, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hellman', 'firstname': 'Tapio', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Centre, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Koivuviita', 'firstname': 'Niina S', 'initials': 'NS', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Centre, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Metsärinne', 'firstname': 'Kaj', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Centre, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Järvisalo', 'firstname': 'Mikko J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Centre, Turku University Hospital and University of Turku, Turku, Finland.\nDepartment of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.\nPerioperative Services, Intensive Care and Pain Medicine, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.'}]",None,"AAC progresses rapidly in patients with CKD, and ΔAAC is similar across the CKD treatment groups including transplant recipients.

278,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34818218,A Preliminary Case-Control Study: Peritoneal Approach in Congestive Heart Failure Treatment.,"Congestive heart failure (CHF) associated with worsening renal function is a very common disorder, and, as well known, the goal of the treatment is reducing venous congestion and maintaining a targeted extracellular volume. The objective of the study is to evaluate regular peritoneal ultrafiltration treatment compared to a standard conservative approach in NYHA III-IV CHF patients. In particular, the primary endpoints of the study were the major event-free survival and the total days of medical care per month (which consist of the days of hospitalization and the number of outpatient visits).
This is a retrospective case-control study. Twenty-four patients were included in the present study. Twelve consecutive patients were treated with peritoneal treatment (group A) and 12 matched for age, gender, and severity of disease with a standard approach. Patients were observed over a maximum period of 18 months. Information on events, hospitalizations, and number of visits was collected during follow-up.
During the follow-up, we observed a major event in 4 patients in group A (33.3%) and in 8 patients in group B (66.7%). In group B, we observed 7 deaths and 1 ICD shock, while in group A, 3 deaths and 1 ICD shock. The number of visits per month was significantly lower in patients treated with the peritoneal method (1.2 [0.4-4.1] vs. 2.5 [2.0-3.1]; p = 0.03). The total days of medical care was significantly lower in group A (2.0 [1.1-5.5] vs. 4.4 [3.0-8.7]; p = 0.034). A multiple event analysis according to the Andersen-Gill model showed a significant event-free survival for group A. During the follow-up, we did not observe any episode of peritonitis in the treated group.
Our study shows that the peritoneal technique is a good therapeutic tool in well-selected patients with CHF. In accordance with prior experience, this intervention has not only an important and significant clinical impact but also potential economic and social consequences.","['Cardio-renal syndrome', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Heart failure', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Ultrafiltration']",Blood purification,2021-11-25,"[{'lastname': 'Ria', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Dialysis, Vito Fazzi Hospital, Lecce, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Borio', 'firstname': 'Gianluca', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rugiu', 'firstname': 'Carlo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Mater Salutis Hospital, Legnago, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Corino', 'firstname': 'Isabella', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Dialysis, S.

A total of 134 patients with NDCKD who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the prospective controlled study and categorized as such: 60 patients in the non-dialysis (ND) group; 36, hemodialysis (HD) group; and 38, peritoneal dialysis (PD) group. Each group was divided into two equal-numbered subgroups for vitamin D supplementation. Those in the experimental subgroups received calcitriol 0.5 ug/day orally, and were followed-up for 6 months. A total of 117 patients were followed-up, including 57 patients in the ND group; 29, HD group; and 31, PD group. Changes in the insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and HOMA-β index were calculated and compared at the time of enrollment and after 1, 3, and 6 months of intervention.
(1) Mean HOMA-IR value: In the ND group, mean HOMA-IR value of the experimental group significantly decreased compared with that of the control group after 3 months of intervention (P = 0.02). In the HD and PD groups, there was no statistical difference between the experimental and control groups (P > 0.05). (2) Mean HOMA-β index: In the ND group, mean HOMA-β index of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group after 1 month of active vitamin D treatment (P = 0.03), and, with an extended intervention time, the index gradually increased (P < 0.001). In the HD group, mean HOMA-β index of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group after 3 months of active vitamin D treatment (P = 0.01). Among PD patients, mean HOMA-β index of the patients in the experimental group was higher than that of the control group after 6 months of active vitamin D treatment (P = 0.02).
Active vitamin D supplementation improved insulin resistance and HOMA-β after 6 months in ND patients, but only improved HOMA-β in the dialysis patients, with no significant effect on insulin resistance.","['Active vitamin D', 'Insulin resistance', 'Islet β-cell function', 'Non-diabetic chronic kidney disease']",International urology and nephrology,2021-11-23,"[{'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Yongxin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, People's Hospital of Yuxi City, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Yuxi City, 653100, Yunnan Province, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': ""Yi'an"", 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, People's Hospital of Yuxi City, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Yuxi City, 653100, Yunnan Province, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Yang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, People's Hospital of Yuxi City, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Yuxi City, 653100, Yunnan Province, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Yongyan', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Beicheng Health Center, Hongta District, Yuxi City, 653100, Yunnan Province, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jingrui', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, People's Hospital of Yuxi City, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Yuxi City, 653100, Yunnan Province, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Yanhong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, People's Hospital of Yuxi City, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Yuxi City, 653100, Yunnan Province, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Fang', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gao', 'firstname': 'Xiufang', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, People's Hospital of Yuxi City, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Yuxi City, 653100, Yunnan Province, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Jianqing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, People's Hospital of Yuxi City, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Yuxi City, 653100, Yunnan Province, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Tong', 'firstname': 'Zongwu', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, People's Hospital of Yuxi City, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, Yuxi City, 653100, Yunnan Province, China. tongzongwud@126.com.""}]",None,None,"(1) Mean HOMA-IR value: In the ND group, mean HOMA-IR value of the experimental group significantly decreased compared with that of the control group after 3 months of intervention (P = 0.02).

30343717",Mortality Risk Factors among Infants Receiving Dialysis in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.,"To identify risk factors associated with mortality for infants receiving dialysis in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted data from the Pediatrix Clinical Data Warehouse on all infants who received dialysis in the NICU from 1999 to 2018. Using a Cox proportional hazards model with robust SEs we estimated the mortality hazard ratios associated with demographics, birth details, medical complications, and treatment exposures.
We identified 273 infants who received dialysis. Median gestational age at birth was 35 weeks (interquartile values 33-37), median birth weight was 2570 g (2000-3084), 8% were small for gestational age, 41% white, and 72% male. Over one-half of the infants (59%) had a kidney anomaly; 71 (26%) infants died before NICU hospital discharge. Factors associated with increased risk of dying after dialysis initiation included lack of kidney anomalies, Black race, gestational age of <32 weeks, necrotizing enterocolitis, dialysis within 7 days of life, and receipt of paralytics or vasopressors (all P < .05).
In this cohort of infants who received dialysis in the NICU over 2 decades, more than 70% of infants survived.

282,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34788858,Safety and immediate humoral response of COVID-19 vaccines in chronic kidney disease patients: the SENCOVAC study.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are at high-risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The multicentric, observational and prospective SENCOVAC study aims to describe the humoral response and safety of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines in CKD patients. Safety and immediate humoral response results are reported here.
Four cohorts of patients were included: kidney transplant (KT) recipients, and haemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and non-dialysis CKD patients from 50 Spanish centres. Adverse events after vaccine doses were recorded. At baseline and on Day 28 after the last vaccine dose, anti-Spike antibodies were measured and compared between cohorts. Factors associated with development of anti-Spike antibodies were analysed.
A total of 1746 participants were recruited: 1116 HD, 171 PD, 176 non-dialysis CKD patients and 283 KT recipients. Most patients (98%) received mRNA vaccines. At least one vaccine reaction developed after the first dose in 763 (53.5%) and after the second dose in 741 (54.5%) of patients. Anti-Spike antibodies were measured in the first 301 patients. At 28 days, 95% of patients had developed antibodies: 79% of KT, 98% of HD, 99% of PD and 100% of non-dialysis CKD patients (P < 0.001). In a multivariate adjusted analysis, absence of an antibody response was independently associated with KT (odds ratio 20.56, P = 0.001) and with BNT162b2 vaccine (odds ratio 6.03, P = 0.023).
The rate of anti-Spike antibody development after vaccination in KT patients was low but in other CKD patients it approached 100%, suggesting that KT patients require persistent isolation measures and booster doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Potential differences between COVID-19 vaccines should be explored in prospective controlled studies.","['COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'antibodies', 'humoral response', 'vaccine']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2021-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Quiroga', 'firstname': 'Borja', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Soler', 'firstname': 'María José', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': ""Nephrology Department, Vall d'Hebrón University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Ortiz', 'firstname': 'Alberto', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'IIS-Fundación Jimenez Diaz, School of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Fundación Renal Iñigo Alvarez de Toledo-IRSIN, REDinREN, Instituto de Investigación Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Martínez Vaquera', 'firstname': 'Shaira', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Diaverum, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Jarava Mantecón', 'firstname': 'Carlos Jesús', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'Diaverum, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Useche', 'firstname': 'Gustavo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Diaverum, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Sánchez Márquez', 'firstname': 'María Gabriela', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Universitario Puerto Real, Cádiz, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Carnerero', 'firstname': 'Manuel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Diaverum, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Jaldo Rodríguez', 'firstname': 'María Teresa', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Infanta Leonor University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Muñoz Ramos', 'firstname': 'Patricia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruiz San Millán', 'firstname': 'Juan Carlos', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Toapanta', 'firstname': 'Nestor', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Nephrology Department, Vall d'Hebrón University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Gracia-Iguacel', 'firstname': 'Carolina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'IIS-Fundación Jimenez Diaz, School of Medicine, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Fundación Renal Iñigo Alvarez de Toledo-IRSIN, REDinREN, Instituto de Investigación Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Aguilar Cervera', 'firstname': 'María Cinta', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital Universitario de Donostia, San Sebastián, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Balibrea Lara', 'firstname': 'Noelia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hospital General Universitario de Alicante, Alicante, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Leyva', 'firstname': 'Alba', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'R&D Department, Vircell S.L., Granada, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Rojas', 'firstname': 'José', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'R&D Department, Vircell S.L., Granada, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gansevoort', 'firstname': 'Ron T', 'initials': 'RT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'de Sequera', 'firstname': 'Patricia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Infanta Leonor University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",None,"The rate of anti-Spike antibody development after vaccination in KT patients was low but in other CKD patients it approached 100%, suggesting that KT patients require persistent isolation measures and booster doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.

283,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34788763,Trimethylamine-N-Oxide Aggravates Kidney Injury via Activation of p38/MAPK Signaling and Upregulation of HuR.,"Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) is an intestinal metabolic toxin, which is produced by gut flora via metabolizing high-choline foods. TMAO is known to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
The objective of this study was to explore the role and mechanism of TMAO aggravating kidney injury.
We used the five-sixths nephrectomy (5/6 Nx)-induced CKD rats to investigate whether TMAO could aggravate kidney damage and its possible mechanisms. Six weeks after the operation, the two groups of 5/6 Nx rats were subjected to intraperitoneal injection with 2.5% glucose peritoneal dialysis fluid (2.5% PDF) and 2.5% PDF plus TMAO 20 mg/kg/day.
In this study, we provided evidence showing TMAO significantly aggravated renal failure as well as inflammatory cell infiltration and in five-sixths nephrectomy-induced CKD rats. We found that TMAO could upregulate inflammatory factors including MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-18 by activating p38 phosphorylation and upregulation of human antigen R. TMAO could aggravate oxidative stress by upregulating NOX4 and downregulating SOD. The result also confirmed that TMAO promoted NLRP3 inflammasome formation as well as cleaved caspase-1 and IL-1β activation in the kidney tissue.
Taken together, the present study validates TMAO as a pro-inflammatory factor that causes renal inflammatory injury and renal function impairment. Inhibition of TMAO synthesis or promoting its clearance may be a potential therapeutic approach of CKD in the future.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Human antigen R', 'Inflammatory injury', 'Trimethylamine-N-oxide', 'p38/MAPK pathway']",Kidney & blood pressure research,2021-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Lai', 'firstname': 'Yunshi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research (Ministry of Education), Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tang', 'firstname': 'Haie', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research (Ministry of Education), Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Xinrong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research (Ministry of Education), Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Zhanmei', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research (Ministry of Education), Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Miaomiao', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research (Ministry of Education), Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Zheng', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research (Ministry of Education), Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhu', 'firstname': 'Fengxin', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research (Ministry of Education), Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research (Ministry of Education), Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Nie', 'firstname': 'Jing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research (Ministry of Education), Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Kidney Disease, Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.'}]","We used the five-sixths nephrectomy (5/6 Nx)-induced CKD rats to investigate whether TMAO could aggravate kidney damage and its possible mechanisms.

30159950",Sex differences in mortality among binational cohort of people with chronic kidney disease: population based data linkage study.,"To evaluate sex differences in mortality among people with kidney failure compared with the general population.
Population based cohort study using data linkage.
The Australian and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA), which includes all patients receiving kidney replacement therapy in Australia (1980-2019) and New Zealand (1988-2019). Data were linked to national death registers to determine deaths and their causes, with additional details obtained from ANZDATA.
Of 82 844 people with kidney failure, 33 329 were female (40%) and 49 555 were male (60%); 49 376 deaths (20 099 in female patients; 29 277 in male patients) were recorded over a total of 536 602 person years of follow-up.
Relative measures of survival, including standardised mortality ratios, relative survival, and years of life lost, using general population data to account for background mortality (adjusting for country, age, sex, and year). Estimates were stratified by dialysis modality (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) and for the subpopulation of kidney transplant recipients.
Few differences in outcomes were found between male and female patients with kidney failure. However, compared with the general population, female patients with kidney failure had greater excess all cause deaths than male patients (female patients: standardised mortality ratio 11.3, 95% confidence interval 11.2 to 11.5, expected deaths 1781, observed deaths 20 099; male patients: 6.9, 6.8 to 6.9, expected deaths 4272, observed deaths 29 277). The greatest difference was observed among younger patients and those who died from cardiovascular disease. Relative survival was also consistently lower in female patients, with adjusted excess mortality 11% higher (95% confidence interval 8% to 13%). Average years of life lost was 3.6 years (95% confidence interval 3.6 to 3.7) greater in female patients with kidney failure compared with male patients across all ages. No major differences were found in mortality by sex for haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Kidney transplantation reduced but did not entirely remove the sex difference in excess mortality, with similar relative survival (P=0.83) and years of life lost difference reduced to 2.3 years (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 2.3) between female and male patients.
Compared with the general population, female patients had greater excess deaths, worse relative survival, and more years of life lost than male patients, however kidney transplantation reduced these differences. Future research should investigate whether systematic differences exist in access to care and possible strategies to mitigate excess mortality among female patients.",[],BMJ (Clinical research ed.),2021-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'De La Mata', 'firstname': 'Nicole L', 'initials': 'NL', 'affiliation': 'Sydney School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosales', 'firstname': 'Brenda', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Sydney School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'MacLeod', 'firstname': 'Grace', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, University of Notre Dame, Fremantle, WA, Australia.\nSydney Medical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kelly', 'firstname': 'Patrick J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': 'Sydney School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Masson', 'firstname': 'Philip', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Morton', 'firstname': 'Rachael L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wyburn', 'firstname': 'Kate', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Sydney Medical School, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.\nRenal Department, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Webster', 'firstname': 'Angela C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Sydney School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.\nCentre for Renal and Transplant Research, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, NSW, Australia.'}]",None,None,"Few differences in outcomes were found between male and female patients with kidney failure.

285,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34784824,Feasibility of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion in children receiving peritoneal dialysis.,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the preferred dialysis modality for paediatric patients with end-stage kidney disease. Frequently, malnutrition is encountered. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the preferred mode of feeding because of its minimal invasive mode of placement and easy handling in daily life. However, reports of a high risk for early post-interventional peritonitis hampered this procedure during PD and controlled studies on the benefit of peri-interventional management to prevent peritonitis are lacking. Here, we report the safety profile of PEG insertion among a cohort of children on PD by using a prophylactic antibiotic and antifungal regimen as well as modification of the PD programme.
We performed a single-centre analysis of paediatric PD patients receiving PEG placement between 2015 and 2020. Demographic data, peri-interventional prophylactic antibiotic and antifungal treatment as well as modification of the PD programme were gathered and the incidence of peritonitis within a period of 28 days after PEG was calculated.
Eight PD patients (median weight 6.7 kg) received PEG insertion. Antibiotic and antifungal prophylaxis were prescribed for median time of 4.0 and 5.0 days, respectively. After individual reduction of PD intensity, all patients continued their regular PD programme after a median of 6 days. One patient developed peritonitis within 24 h after PEG insertion and simultaneous surgery for hydrocele.
Applying an antibiotic and antifungal prophylactic regime as well as an adapted PD programme may reduce the risk for peritonitis in paediatric PD patients who receive PEG procedure.","['Children', 'chronic kidney disease', 'percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'peritonitis']",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,2021-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Kempf', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Nephrology and Metabolic Diseases, Charité\xa0- University Medicine Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Holle', 'firstname': 'Johannes', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Nephrology and Metabolic Diseases, Charité\xa0- University Medicine Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Berns', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Nephrology and Metabolic Diseases, Charité\xa0- University Medicine Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Henning', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Nephrology and Metabolic Diseases, Charité\xa0- University Medicine Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Bufler', 'firstname': 'Philip', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Nephrology and Metabolic Diseases, Charité\xa0- University Medicine Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Müller', 'firstname': 'Dominik', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Nephrology and Metabolic Diseases, Charité\xa0- University Medicine Berlin, Germany.'}]",None,None,"Eight PD patients (median weight 6.7 kg) received PEG insertion.

286,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34739194,Daprodustat for the Treatment of Anemia in Patients Undergoing Dialysis.,"Among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the use of recombinant human erythropoietin and its derivatives for the treatment of anemia has been linked to a possibly increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and other adverse events. Several trials have suggested that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (PHIs) are as effective as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) in increasing hemoglobin levels.
In this randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial, we assigned patients with CKD who were undergoing dialysis and who had a hemoglobin level of 8.0 to 11.5 g per deciliter to receive an oral HIF-PHI (daprodustat) or an injectable ESA (epoetin alfa if they were receiving hemodialysis or darbepoetin alfa if they were receiving peritoneal dialysis). The two primary outcomes were the mean change in the hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 (noninferiority margin, -0.75 g per deciliter) and the first occurrence of a major adverse cardiovascular event (a composite of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke), with a noninferiority margin of 1.25.
A total of 2964 patients underwent randomization. The mean (±SD) baseline hemoglobin level was 10.4±1.0 g per deciliter overall. The mean (±SE) change in the hemoglobin level from baseline to weeks 28 through 52 was 0.28±0.02 g per deciliter in the daprodustat group and 0.10±0.02 g per deciliter in the ESA group (difference, 0.18 g per deciliter; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12 to 0.24), which met the prespecified noninferiority margin of -0.75 g per deciliter. During a median follow-up of 2.5 years, a major adverse cardiovascular event occurred in 374 of 1487 patients (25.2%) in the daprodustat group and in 394 of 1477 (26.7%) in the ESA group (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.07), which also met the prespecified noninferiority margin for daprodustat. The percentages of patients with other adverse events were similar in the two groups.
Among patients with CKD undergoing dialysis, daprodustat was noninferior to ESAs regarding the change in the hemoglobin level from baseline and cardiovascular outcomes.

A high concentration of TMAO has been proven to relate to cardiovascular disease (CVD), all-cause mortality and chronic kidney disease progression. We aimed to investigate the relation between the value of serum TMAO and outcomes for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
This is a prospective cohort study with data retrospectively analysed. All incident PD patients were enrolled and followed up. Log-rank test, competing risk survival analysis and COX regression were performed to test the effect of serum TMAO on developing first-episode peritonitis, all-cause and CVD mortality.
A wide distribution of serum TMAO concentration was observed in 513 PD patients, with a median level of 72.3 (43.7, 124.7) µmol/L. Patients with lower TMAO concentration were more likely to be without diabetes and hypertension. Patients with lower TMAO concentration showed better residual kidney function and solute clearance at baseline. Participants in the higher three TMAO quartiles showed an increased risk for first-episode peritonitis (

Home hemodialysis has already been used in the past and today has found new technologies and new applications. The patient's autonomy and the need for a caregiver during the sessions are still the main limiting factors. In this multicenter observational study, 7 patients were enrolled for 24 months. They underwent six weekly hemodialysis sessions of 180' each; periodic medical examinations and blood tests were performed (3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months). After 3-6 months of home hemodialysis there was already an improvement in the control of calcium-phosphorus metabolism (improvement in phosphorus values, (p <0.01), a reduction in parathyroid hormone (p <0.01)); in the number of phosphorus binders used (p <0.02); in blood pressure control (with a reduction in the number of hypotensive drugs p <0.02).

Costs and prevalence obtained from the main financers and providers in each country; analysis of cost-effectiveness using a Markov model with a five-year horizon, evaluating resource allocation strategies for their incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as quality-adjusted years of life.
There is observed dispersion among countries in terms of access to and beneficial value of RRTs, affecting their prevalence and monetary breakeven point. From the cost standpoint, it is more efficient to promote transplants and peritoneal dialysis, and to discourage hemodialysis, although the availability of each RRT in each country required a specific evaluation.
Promoting transplants saves costs, but the variable breakeven points make it necessary to determine different cost-effectiveness thresholds for each country. In Argentina and Uruguay, RRTs would be more cost-effective with an increase in the number of patients in peritoneal dialysis and higher donation rates for transplants. In Costa Rica (where there is a high transplant rate and large budgetary margin), the use of dialysis is aligned with demand and with the incidence of patients with terminal chronic kidney disease.

Se observa dispersión entre los países en el acceso y los valores prestacionales de TRR, que afectan su prevalencia y el punto de equilibrio monetario. Desde el punto de vista de los costos, es más eficiente promover la realización de trasplantes y de diálisis peritoneal, y desalentar la indicación de hemodiálisis, aunque la disponibilidad de cada TRR por país requirió evaluaciones particulares.
Promover la realización de trasplantes ahorra costos, aunque los puntos de equilibrio variables requieren determinar diferentes umbrales de costo-efectividad por país. En Argentina y Uruguay, la administración de TRR mejoraría su eficiencia si se aumentan la cantidad de pacientes en diálisis peritoneal y las tasas de donación para trasplantes. En Costa Rica (donde hay tasas elevadas de trasplantes y margen presupuestario), la incorporación de técnicas dialíticas se ajusta por demanda e incidencia de pacientes con ERCT.

290,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34673277,Gut microbial metabolite TMAO increases peritoneal inflammation and peritonitis risk in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-produced metabolite, is accumulated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. It is well known to contribute to CKD-related cardiovascular complications. However, the effect of TMAO on peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that serum concentrations of TMAO were positively correlated with C-reactive protein levels, and the appearance rate of dialysate IL-6 and PAI-1, in PD patients. During the follow-up period of 28.3 ± 8.0 months, patients with higher TMAO levels (≥50 μM) had a higher risk of new-onset peritonitis (HR, 3.60; 95%CI, 1.18-10.99; P=0.025) after adjusting for sex, age, diabetes, PD duration, BUN, rGFR, C-reactive protein, BMI and β2-M. In CKD rat models, TMAO significantly promoted peritoneal dialysate-induced inflammatory cell infiltration, inflammatory cytokines production in the peritoneum. In vitro study revealed that TMAO directly induced primary peritoneal mesothelial cell necrosis, together with increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including CCL2, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. In addition, TMAO significantly increased TNF-α-induced P-selectin production in mesothelial cells, as well as high glucose-induced TNF-α and CCL2 expression in endothelial cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that higher levels of TMAO exacerbate peritoneal inflammation and might be a risk factor of incidence of peritonitis in PD patients.",[],Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,2021-10-22,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Lei', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research, National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Disease, Key Laboratory of Organ Failure Research (Ministry of Education), Division of Nephrology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, P.R.

33320346",Unplanned vs. planned peritoneal dialysis as initial therapy for dialysis patients in chronic kidney replacement therapy.,"To compare infectious and mechanical complications, technique failure and mortality of a planned PD vs. an unplanned PD program.
It was a prospective observational study that included chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients who started PD according to medical recommendation: group1-planned and group 2-unplanned PD.
This study evaluated patients who started planned and unplanned PD programs in a teaching hospital from July 2014 to December 2017.
A total of 58 patients were included in the planned PD group and 113 in the unplanned PD group. There was difference between the two groups in leak and hospital admissions, that were more frequent in the unplanned PD group. Periods free from exite site infection, peritonitis and mechanical complications were longer in the planned group. Cox regression analysis identified age and the lowest albumin value as factors associated with mechanical complications; peritonitis indicated the presence of ESI and mechanical complications; the change to HD was associated with a younger age, mechanical complications, diabetes mellitus (DM) and peritonitis. The factors associated with death were age and lower values of albumin. After 48 months, the growth of the PD program was 252%.
The technique survival and patient mortality in unplanned PD was similar to planned PD, while the period marked by the absence of complications related to PD was longer in the planned PD group. In the Cox regression, unplanned PD was not identified as risk factor for death, transition to HD or complications related to therapy, while age and lower albumin values were predictors of negative outcomes.
Unplanned PD is not risk factor for death and complications related to PD and can be an option to unplanned HD.","['Dialysis', 'Nursing home care', 'Peritoneal dialysis']",International urology and nephrology,2021-10-20,"[{'lastname': 'Mendes', 'firstname': 'Marcela Lara', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Botucatu School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo State, Avenue Mario Rubens Montenegro, PO 18600000, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Alves', 'firstname': 'Camila Albuquerque', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Botucatu School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo State, Avenue Mario Rubens Montenegro, PO 18600000, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Marinho', 'firstname': 'Laudilene Cristina Rebello', 'initials': 'LCR', 'affiliation': 'Botucatu School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo State, Avenue Mario Rubens Montenegro, PO 18600000, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Dias', 'firstname': 'Dayana Bitencourt', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'Botucatu School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo State, Avenue Mario Rubens Montenegro, PO 18600000, Botucatu, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Ponce', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Botucatu School of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo State, Avenue Mario Rubens Montenegro, PO 18600000, Botucatu, SP, Brazil. daniela.ponce@unesp.br.'}]",None,"The technique survival and patient mortality in unplanned PD was similar to planned PD, while the period marked by the absence of complications related to PD was longer in the planned PD group.

292,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34643362,Kidney Disease: End-Stage Renal Disease.,"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) affects approximately 745,000 individuals in the United States. Patients with ESRD are dependent on renal replacement therapy (RRT) via dialysis or kidney transplantation. The two dialysis modalities are peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. No differences in long-term mortality rates between the two modalities have been shown. Peritoneal dialysis is performed at home. Hemodialysis typically is performed at a dialysis center through vascular access via an arteriovenous fistula (which must mature for several months before use), an arteriovenous graft (which can be used in as few as 24 hours, depending on the graft material), or a central venous catheter (usable immediately but associated with the highest risk of infection). Transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with ESRD, and referral should be offered to patients who are candidates. However, some patients with ESRD decide against RRT and opt for supportive care. For these patients, and for patients who choose to discontinue dialysis, palliative care and hospice referral are indicated. For all patients with advanced chronic kidney disease or ESRD, treatment includes management of complications, including hyperkalemia, hypervolemia, metabolic acidosis, anemia, mineral and bone disorders, and protein-calorie malnutrition.",[],FP essentials,2021-10-14,"[{'lastname': 'Braun', 'firstname': 'Michael M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Madigan Army Medical Center - Internal Medicine, 9040 Jackson Ave, Tacoma, WA 98431.'}, {'lastname': 'Khayat', 'firstname': 'Maurice', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Madigan Army Medical Center - Nephrology, 9040 Jackson Ave, Tacoma, WA 98431.'}]",None,None,None,Written permission from the American Academy of Family Physicians is required for reproduction of this material in whole or in part in any form or medium.,None,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17fc0a520>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,34643362,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34643362,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

25742006",Peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis caused by Gordonia bronchialis: first pediatric report.,"Gordonia species, aerobic, weakly acid-fast, Gram-positive bacilli, are a rare cause of peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). We report the first pediatric case of PD-related peritonitis caused by Gordonia bronchialis.
A 13-year-old girl with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5D, on continuous cycling PD (CCPD) for 8 years, presented with cloudy PD effluent, with no abdominal discomfort or fever. Intra-peritoneal (IP) loading doses of vancomycin and ceftazidime were started at home after obtaining a PD effluent sample, which showed WBC 2,340 × 10 /L (59% neutrophils) and Gram-positive bacilli. On admission, she was clinically well and afebrile, with no history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, so vancomycin was discontinued, and IP ceftazidime and cefazolin were started, following a loading dose of intravenous cefazolin. Gordonia species grew after 5 days of incubation and later identified as Gordonia bronchialis. IP vancomycin was restarted as monotherapy, empirically for a total of 3 weeks therapy. A 2-week course of oral ciprofloxacin was added, based on susceptibility testing. PD catheter replacement was advised due to the risk of recurrence but was refused. A relapse occurred 16 days after discontinuing antibiotics, successfully treated with a 2-week course of IP ceftazidime and vancomycin. The PD catheter was removed and hemodialysis initiated. She received a further 2-week course of oral ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate post PD catheter removal.
Gordonia bronchialis is an emerging pathogen in PD peritonitis and appears to be associated with a high risk of relapse. PD catheter replacement is strongly suggested.","['Child', 'Gordonia bronchialis', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Peritonitis']","Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2021-10-12,"[{'lastname': 'Bruno', 'firstname': 'Valentina', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada. valentina.bruno@sickkids.ca.\nDepartment of Paediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. valentina.bruno@sickkids.ca.'}, {'lastname': 'Tjon', 'firstname': 'James', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacy, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Sandy', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Groves', 'firstname': 'Helen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDivision of Infectious Diseases, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Kazmi', 'firstname': 'Kescha', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Paediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.\nDivision of Infectious Diseases, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Zappitelli', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada.\nDepartment of Paediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Harvey', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, ON, M5G 1X8, Canada.\nDepartment of Paediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.'}]",None,None,None,"© 2021.

28123752",Diabetes mellitus in dialysis and renal transplantation.,"Diabetes mellitus is the commonest cause of end-stage kidney failure worldwide and is a proven and significant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. Renal impairment has a significant impact on the physiology of glucose homeostasis as it reduces tissue sensitivity to insulin and reduces insulin clearance. Renal replacement therapy itself affects glucose control: peritoneal dialysis may induce hyperglycaemia due to glucose-rich dialysate and haemodialysis often causes hypoglycaemia due to the relatively low concentration of glucose in the dialysate. Autonomic neuropathy which is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes increases the risk for asymptomatic hypoglycaemia. Pharmacological options for improving glycaemic control are limited due to alterations to drug metabolism. Impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes are also common in the post-kidney-transplant setting and increase the risk of graft failure and mortality. This review seeks to summarise the literature and tackle the intricacies of glycaemic management in patients with CKD who are either on maintenance haemodialysis or have received a kidney transplant. It outlines changes to glycaemic targets, monitoring of glycaemic control, the use of oral hypoglycaemic agents, the management of severe hyperglycaemia in dialysis and kidney transplantation patients.","['diabetes mellitus', 'dialysis', 'kidney transplantation', 'management']",Therapeutic advances in endocrinology and metabolism,2021-10-12,"[{'lastname': 'Ben-David', 'firstname': 'Eyal', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Renal and Transplantation Unit, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Hull', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Renal and Transplantation Unit, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Banerjee', 'firstname': 'Debasish', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Renal and Transplantation Unit, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Room G2.113, Second Floor, Grosvenor Wing, Blackshaw Road, Tooting, London SW17 0QT, UK.""}]",None,None,None,"© The Author(s), 2021.","10.1177/20420188211048663

296,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34620355,Nutritional predictors associated with malnutrition in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients.,"Currently in China, out of the total dialysis population, approximately 20% represents continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and almost half of CAPD patients was affected by malnutrition. This study aimed to investigate the association between nutritional predictors and malnutrition with 5.1 years of dialysis according to the subjective global assessment (SGA) in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients.
A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2013 to May 2018 and included 70 CAPD patients. The relationship between anthropometric and biochemical parameters with malnutrition was assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis.
The prevalence of malnutrition in CAPD patients was 52.9%. Our result revealed a 7.05-fold increased odds of malnutrition for patients with protein equivalent of total nitrogen appearance normalized to body weight (nPNA) < 1.0 g/kg per day (d) versus patients with normal nPNA (confidence interval (CI) 1.33-37.34; p < 0.05). Patients whose normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) was <1.2 g/(kg/d) had a significant positive association with malnutrition versus patients with normal nPCR (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 7.99; p < 0.05). Patients with dietary protein intake (DPI) < 1.0 g/(kg/d) had a higher likelihood of malnutrition than those with normal DPI (OR 12.73; p < 0.05). CAPD patients with upper arm circumference (UAC) < 23.2 cm had a high risk of malnutrition versus patients with normal UAC (OR 12.99; p < 0.05).
Our study suggested a close association between nPNA, DPI, nPCR, and UAC and malnutrition in CAPD patients. Further studies can be warranted the use of these variables as predictors and a malnutrition consequence among Chinese CAPD patients.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis', 'End-stage renal disease', 'Malnutrition', 'Subjective global assessment']",Clinical nutrition ESPEN,2021-10-09,"[{'lastname': 'Hiruy', 'firstname': 'Aschalew Fikru', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition and Food Hygiene, Hubei Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, School of Public Health, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 13 Hangkong Road, Wuhan, 430030, Hubei, China.

We performed a single-center prospective cohort study. Patients who were planned for peritoneal dialysis were recruited. miR-130b and miR-17-5p expressions were measured from subcutaneous and pre-peritoneal fat tissue obtained during peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion.

27452672",Circulating irisin level in chronic kidney disease patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Irisin is not only a myokine but also an adipokine that is critical in many diseases including in the development of such diseases as obesity, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, and chronic inflammation. However, the association between irisin and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unclear. This systematic review aimed to assess circulating irisin levels in patients with CKD and compare them with those in non-CKD patients.
PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, and CNKI were searched to identify observational studies of circulating irisin levels in patients with CKD. Two reviewers independently searched the databases and screened studies according to the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted using a standardized collection form. Meta-analysis was performed to compare the differences in circulating irisin levels between CKD and non-CKD patients.
A total of 9 studies (6 cross-sectional and 3 case controls) involving 859 CKD patients and 393 non-CKD individuals were selected. The pooled data indicated that circulating irisin concentrations were significantly lower in CKD nondialysis patients (WMD = - 84.79, 95% CI - 170.23, 0.50; p < 0.05), peritoneal dialysis patients (WMD = - 235.81, 95% CI - 421.99, - 49.62; p = 0.01), and hemodialysis patients (WMD = - 217.46, 95% CI - 381.35, - 53.57; p = 0.009) than in healthy controls.
This study confirmed that irisin levels were decreased in patients with CKD.

16623414","Peritoneal dialysis in Tunisia: complications, technique and patient's survival (twenty-seven years of experience in a single center).","peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a renal replacement therapy method that offers various advantages to end-stage renal disease patients. The aim of our study was to analyze patient characteristics, peritonitis and clinical outcome over a 27-year period of PD in our center.
retrospective study of incident patients on PD from January 1990 to December 2017. A total of 304 patients were enrolled in the study group. All patients over 15 years of age entering the dialysis program were included in the study. Patients dropping out from PD within three months were all excluded. Biochemical and demographic variables, peritonitis episodes and patient and technique survival were analyzed.
the PD prevalence in our center was 4.5% during the study period; the mean age was 46.47 ± 18.6 years; diabetic nephropathy was the main cause of chronic kidney disease: 35.5% (n=108). Cardiovascular disease was the main cause of death: 39.6% (n=34). The peritonitis rate was 0.68 episode per patient-year. Ultrafiltration failure was the most important cause of PD withdrawal: 43% (n=60). Occurrence of peritonitis was the only independent predictor of technique failure: adjusted relative risk [aRR] 5.07, 95% CI 2.69-9.58; p<0.001. The overall non-adjusted patient survival was around 100%, 95% and less than 20% at 1, 4 and 25 years respectively basing on the Kaplan-Meier analysis. The group undergoing renal transplantation had the best survival rate.
peritonitis remains the most common complication as well as the most provider of technique failure and patient´s transfer to hemodialysis. The technique survival was better in case of absence of peritonitis.

Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in patients treated with PD. This research investigated the correlation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration and anemia, microinflammation, and oxidative stress in PD patients.
62 PD patients and 56 healthy volunteers were recruited in this research. Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and basic parameters of anemia were detected. The correlation between serum 25(OH)D concentration with anemia, oxidative stress, and microinflammatory state were analyzed.
In the PD group, the concentration of 25(OH)D was lower than the healthy control (HC) group (p < 0.001). Hemoglobin, red blood cell count (RBC), and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) in the PD group was significantly lower (all p < 0.001), while high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) concentrations were significantly higher, than the HC group (all p < 0.001). In the PD group, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was higher than in the HC group (p < 0.001), while superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were lower (both p < 0.001). Serum 25(OH)D exhibited positive correlation with hemoglobin (r = 0.4509, p = 0.0002), RBC (r = 0.3712, p = 0.0030), TIBC (r = 0.4700, p = 0.0001), SOD (r = 0.4992, p < 0.0001) and GSH-Px (r = 0.4312, p = 0.0005), and negative correlation with hs-CRP (r = - 0.4040, p = 0.0011), TNF-α (r = - 0.4721, p = 0.0001), IL-6 (r = - 0.5378, p < 0.0001) and MDA (r = - 0.3056, p = 0.0157).
In conclusion, reduced serum 25(OH)D concentrations in PD patients contribute to anemia, oxidative stress and microinflammatory state.","['Anemia of chronic kidney disease', 'Microinflammation', 'Oxidative stress', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Vitamin D']",Journal of translational medicine,2021-09-29,"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Chi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Affiliated Suqian Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No. 138 Huanghe Road South, Suqian, 223800, Jiangsu, China.\nXuzhou Medical University, No. 99 West Huai-hai Road, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Junsheng', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Affiliated Suqian Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No. 138 Huanghe Road South, Suqian, 223800, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Xiaohui', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Affiliated Suqian Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No. 138 Huanghe Road South, Suqian, 223800, Jiangsu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Dong', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The Affiliated Suqian Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, No. 138 Huanghe Road South, Suqian, 223800, Jiangsu, China. sundong126yahoo@126.com.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine and Diagnostics, Xuzhou Medical University, No. 99 West Huai-hai Road, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu, China. sundong126yahoo@126.com.'}]",None,"In conclusion, reduced serum 25(OH)D concentrations in PD patients contribute to anemia, oxidative stress and microinflammatory state.","In the PD group, the concentration of 25(OH)D was lower than the healthy control (HC) group (p < 0.001).

301,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34579595,24-h Glycaemic profiles in peritoneal dialysis patients and non-dialysis controls with advanced kidney disease.,"For patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), the deleterious effects of high concentrations of dialysate glucose on the peritoneal membrane are well-documented. Systemic effects of peritoneally absorbed glucose are more poorly defined. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), we aimed to describe 24-h glycaemic profiles of PD patients without diabetes and compare with non-dialysis controls with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD-5).
In this cross-sectional, case-control study, 15 patients on PD (9 automated PD (APD) and 6 continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD)) and 16 CKD-5 controls underwent 72 h of CGM and metabolic profiling. CGM was used to derive average glucose concentrations and within-participant standard deviation (SD) of glucose. Data were analysed for the whole 72-h monitoring period and as daytime (09.00 to 21.00) and night-time (21.00 to 09.00).
Average glucose concentrations and within-participant SD of glucose for the whole monitoring period were not different between the three groups (
Systematically different glycaemic patterns were observed in non-diabetic APD and CAPD patients, including an absence of physiological nocturnal glucose dipping in patients on APD. Comprehensive CGM data sets highlight subtleties not appreciated by traditional metabolic biomarkers; this has implications when choosing the most appropriate outcome measures in future research addressing the metabolic impact of PD.","['Continuous glucose monitoring', 'metabolic', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,2021-09-29,"[{'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Diabetes and Vascular Medicine Research Centre, NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility, University of Exeter College of Medicine and Health, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gilchrist', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Diabetes and Vascular Medicine Research Centre, NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility, University of Exeter College of Medicine and Health, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Strain', 'firstname': 'William David', 'initials': 'WD', 'affiliation': 'Diabetes and Vascular Medicine Research Centre, NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility, University of Exeter College of Medicine and Health, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fraser', 'firstname': 'Donald', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Wales Kidney Research Unit, Cardiff University, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Shore', 'firstname': 'Angela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Diabetes and Vascular Medicine Research Centre, NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility, University of Exeter College of Medicine and Health, UK.'}]",None,None,Average glucose concentrations and within-participant SD of glucose for the whole monitoring period were not different between the three groups (,None,10.1177/08968608211047787,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17f999710>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,34579595,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34579595,1.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

303,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34556353,Characteristics and technical survival of home hemodialysis in the Valencian Community (1976-2020).,"Home hemodialysis (HDD) is implemented in the Valencian Community with a higher prevalence than to the rest of the national territory, with a prevalence of 13.4 patients' pmp in December 2018. We carried out an assessment of the patients' characteristics and the overall and technical survival in HDD depending on the historical moment of onset and its origin.
We conducted a retrospective and descriptive study including patients of the Valencian Registry of Renal Patients from the beginning of data reported until December 2020. We calculated overall survival (combined event death-technical failure, censoring transplantation) and technical survival (event technical failure, censoring exitus and transplantation). Comparing technical survival according to the starting era: ancient (1976-2000) vs modern (2001-2020) and according to the modality of origin. We performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression in the total series for both overall and technical survivals.
236 patients on HDD (611.4 patient-years of follow-up), mean age 49.7±16.3 years; median time of prior renal replacement therapy 0.2 years. The ratio of transplantation, death, and technical failure were 13.2, 4.4, and 7 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. In the comparison by ancient (n=57) vs modern (n=179) eras, age (37.5 vs 53.5 years), DM (3.5 vs 13.4%) and chronic tubuleinterstitial nephropathy (24.6 vs 8.9%) as a cause of chronic kidney disease were statistically significant. The probability of coming from outpatient consultation (33.3 vs 48.6%) and peritoneal dialysis (1.8 vs 12.8%) were higher in modern era with statistical significance. In the ancient era a single hospital centralized 57.9% of the patients, and in the modern era between two hospitals centralized 55.8% of the patients. Overall survival in the ancient era was 83.7% at 1 year, 77.4% at 2 years, and 61% at 5 years; and in the modern era 87.3% per year, 83% 2 years and 47.8% 5 years (Log Rank 0.521). Technical survival in the ancient era was 85.4% at 1 year, 79% 2 years, and 64.1% 5 years; and in the modern era 91.4% per year, 88.5% 2 years and 74.5% 5 years (Log Rank 0.195). There were no statistical differences in the comparison based on technical of provenance. In the Cox regression it was statistically significant for overall survival: the age and being diagnosed with heart disease, vascular disease or active neoplasia and for technical survival liver disease or social problem, both in univariate and multivariate.
In the modern era there is a considerable increase in HDD patients in the Valencian Community. There was a center effect in the development of HDD programs, most of the patients depended on few healthcare centers. The patients were older and had greater comorbidity in the modern era, despite this without affecting the technical and overall survival of the HDD.","['Hemodialysis', 'Hemodiálisis', 'Hemodiálisis domiciliaria', 'Home hemodialysis', 'Registro', 'Registry', 'Supervivencia técnica', 'Technical survival']",Nefrologia,2021-09-25,"[{'lastname': 'Pérez Alba', 'firstname': 'Alejandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Servicio de Nefrología, Hospital General Universitario de Castellón, Castelló de la Plana, España.

This European, phase 3, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study investigated efficacy and safety of roxadustat in patients with end-stage kidney disease on dialysis for at least 4 months.
Patients were randomized to switch from an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) (epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa) to roxadustat three times/week or to continue their previous ESA. Roxadustat and ESA doses were adjusted to maintain hemoglobin within 10.0-12.0 g/dL during the treatment period (day 1 up to 52-104 weeks). Primary endpoints were hemoglobin change from baseline (CFB) to the average of weeks 28-36 without rescue therapy and hemoglobin CFB to the average of weeks 28-52 regardless of rescue therapy. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed descriptively.
Of 1081 screened patients, 836 were randomized and received treatment (roxadustat, n = 415; ESA, n = 421). The least squares means (95% CI) of the treatment difference (roxadustat - ESA) for hemoglobin CFB to weeks 28-36 (without rescue therapy) and CFB to weeks 28-52 (regardless of rescue therapy) were 0.235 (0.132, 0.339) g/dL and 0.171 (0.082, 0.261) g/dL, respectively, demonstrating non-inferiority of roxadustat to ESA (non-inferiority margin of - 0.75 g/dL). The proportions of patients who achieved target hemoglobin without rescue therapy during weeks 28-36 were 84.2% (roxadustat) and 82.4% (ESA). Roxadustat was superior to ESA in decreasing LDL cholesterol from baseline to the average of weeks 12-28. Serious TEAEs occurred in 50.7% (roxadustat) and 45.0% (ESA) of patients. Common TEAEs in both treatment groups included hypertension, arteriovenous fistula thrombosis, headache, and diarrhea.
Roxadustat was non-inferior to ESAs in maintaining hemoglobin levels in this cohort of patients with anemia of CKD on dialysis for at least 4 months who were previously treated with ESAs.

305,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34518130,[Epidemiology of pediatric chronic kidney disease].,"Major advances have been made in the management of children with chronic kidney disease over the past 30 years. However, existing epidemiology data are primarily from kidney replacement therapy registries, and information available at earlier stages of chronic kidney disease is limited. The incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease stages 2 to 5 remain poorly understood. However, rare population-based studies suggest that the prevalence of all-stage chronic kidney disease may be as high as 1% of the pediatric population. Congenital disorders including congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract and hereditary nephropathies account for one-half to two-thirds of pediatric chronic kidney disease cases in middle and high-income countries, whereas acquired nephropathies seem to predominate in low-income countries. The progression of chronic kidney disease is slower in children with congenital disorders than in those with acquired nephropathy, particularly glomerular disease, resulting in a lower proportion of congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract as a cause of end-stage kidney disease compared to less advanced stages of chronic kidney disease. The incidence of kidney replacement therapy in the pediatric population ranged by country from 1 to 14 per million children of the same age in 2018 (approximately 8 per million children in France) in patients younger than 20 years. The prevalence of kidney replacement therapy in children under 20 years of age in 2018 ranged from 15-30 per million children in some Eastern European and Latin American countries to 100 per million children in Finland and the United States (56 per million children in France). Most children with end-stage kidney disease initiate kidney replacement therapy with dialysis (more frequently hemodialysis than peritoneal dialysis). In about 20% of cases, the initial kidney replacement therapy modality is a pre-emptive kidney transplantation. In high-income countries, 60-80% of prevalent children with end-stage kidney disease live with a functioning transplant (75% in France). While the survival of children with chronic kidney disease has continuously improved over time, mortality remains about 30 times higher than in the general pediatric population.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Insuffisance rénale terminale', 'Registry', 'children, Kidney replacement therapy', 'enfant, Maladie rénale chronique', 'enfant, Registres', 'Épidémiologie maladie rénale chronique']",Nephrologie & therapeutique,2021-09-15,"[{'lastname': 'Harambat', 'firstname': 'Jérôme', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Unité de néphrologie pédiatrique, hôpital Pellegrin-Enfants, Centre hospitalier universitaire de Bordeaux, place Amélie Raba-Léon, 33076 Bordeaux, France; Université de Bordeaux, 146\xa0rue Léo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux, France.

Between January 2018 and March 2019, a physician-initiated, nonrandomized, prospective study was conducted. Carotid IMT, vascular calcifications analysis values and measurements of the ABPI, were made at baseline and after 1-year of follow-up.
A total of 284 patients, 152 patients with dialysis (100 hemodialysis (HD) and 52 CAPD (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis)) and 132 patients with stage 4 chronic kidney disease (control group), were included (55% male, 67 [29-88] years). The values of carotid IMT at baseline were higher in the HD group than in the CAPD group (1.10±0.08 mm vs. 0.08±0.04 mm, P=0.004). Adragao and Kauppila scores were higher in the HD group than in the CAPD group (2.56±2.10 vs. 1.08±2.02, P=0.009; and 7.40±6.86 vs. 4.44±5.26, P<0.001; respectively).

15378418",Etiologic-sociodemographic assessment and comparison of dialysis modalities in pediatric Syrian migrants with chronic kidney disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are among the important causes of mortality and morbidity in childhood. Early diagnosis and treatment of the underlying primary disease may prevent most of CKD patients from progressing to ESRD. There is no study examining chronic kidney diseases and dialysis modalities in Syrian immigrant children. We aimed to retrospectively research the etiologic, sociodemographic, and clinical factors in CKD among Syrian refugee children, and at the same time, to compare the clinical characteristics of patients with ESRD on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis.
Our study included a total of 79 pediatric Syrian patients aged from 2-16 years monitored at Hatay State Hospital pediatric nephrology clinic with diagnosis of various stages of CKD and with ESRD. Physical-demographic features and clinical-laboratory information were retrospectively screened.
The most common cause of CKD was congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tracts (CAKUT) (37.9%). Other causes were urolitiasis (15.1%), nephrotic syndrome (10.1%), spina bifida (8.8%), hemolytic uremic syndrome (7.5%), and glomerulonephritis (7.5%). Twenty-five patients used hemodialysis due to bad living conditions. Only 2 of the patients with peritoneal dialysis were using automatic peritoneal dialysis (APD), with 5 using continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Long-term complications like left ventricle hypertrophy and retinopathy were significantly higher among hemodialysis patients. There was no difference identified between the groups in terms of hypertension and sex.
Progression to ESRD due to preventable reasons is very frequent among CKD patients. For more effective use of peritoneal dialysis in pediatric patients, the responsibility of states must be improved.
Doença renal crônica (DRC) e doença renal em estágio terminal (DRET) estão entre as causas importantes de mortalidade e morbidade na infância. Diagnóstico precoce e tratamento da doença primária subjacente podem evitar que a maioria dos pacientes com DRC progrida para DRET. Não há estudos examinando doenças renais crônicas e modalidades de diálise em crianças imigrantes sírias. Visamos pesquisar retrospectivamente fatores etiológicos, sociodemográficos e clínicos na DRC entre crianças refugiadas sírias e, ao mesmo tempo, comparar características clínicas de pacientes com DRET em diálise peritoneal e hemodiálise.
Nosso estudo incluiu 79 pacientes pediátricos sírios com idades entre 2-16 anos monitorados na clínica de nefrologia pediátrica, Hospital Estadual de Hatay, com diagnóstico de vários estágios de DRC e com DRET. Características físico-demográficas e informações clínico-laboratoriais foram examinadas retrospectivamente.
A causa mais comum de DRC foram anomalias congênitas dos rins e trato urinário (CAKUT) (37,9%). Outras causas foram urolitíase (15,1%), síndrome nefrótica (10,1%), espinha bífida (8,8%), síndrome hemolítico-urêmica (7,5%), e glomerulonefrite (7,5%). 25 pacientes fizeram hemodiálise devido às más condições de vida. Apenas 2 dos pacientes em diálise peritoneal estavam usando diálise peritoneal automatizada (DPA), com 5 em diálise peritoneal ambulatorial contínua (DPAC). Complicações em longo prazo, como hipertrofia do ventrículo esquerdo e retinopatia, foram significativamente maiores entre pacientes em hemodiálise. Não identificou-se diferença entre grupos em termos de hipertensão e sexo.

308,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34481678,Transitions in an integrated model of renal replacement therapy in a regional health system.,"The choice of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is an important decision that determines the quality of life and survival. Most patients change from one RRT modality to another to adapt RRT to clinical and psychosocial needs. This has been called «integrated model of RRT» that implies new questions about the best sequence of techniques.
The study describes the impact of transitions between RRT modalities on survival using the Madrid Registry of Renal Patients (2008-2018). This study used the proportional hazards models and competitive risk models to perform an intention-to-treat (ITT), according to their 1
A total of 8971 patients started RRT during this period in Madrid (6.6 Million population): 7207 (80.3%) on hemodialysis (HD), 1401 (15.6%) on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 363 (4.2%) received a pre-emptive kidney transplantation (KTX). Incident HD-patients were older (HD group 65.3 years (SD 15.3) vs PD group 58.1 years (SD 14.8) vs KTX group 52 years (SD 17.2); p<0.001) and had more comorbidities. They presented higher mortality (HD group 40.9% vs PD group 22.8% vs 8.3% KTX group, p<0.001) and less access to a transplant (HD group 30.4% vs DP group 51.6%; p<0.001). Transitions between dialysis techniques define different groups of patients with different clinical outcomes. Those who change from HD to PD do it earlier (HD→PD: 0.7 years (SD 1.1) vs PD→HD: 1.5 years (SD 1.4) p<0.001), are younger (HD→PD: 53.5 years (SD 16.7) vs PD→HD: 61.6 years (SD 14.6); p<0.001), presented less mortality (HD→PD: 24.5% vs PD→HD: 32.0%; p<0.001) and higher access to a transplant (HD→PD: 49.4% vs PD→HD: 31.7%; p<0.001). Survival analysis by competitive risks is essential for integrated RRT models, especially in groups such as PD patients, where 51.6% of the patients were considered as lost follow-up (received a KTX after during the first 2.5 years on PD). In this analysis, survival of patients who change from one technique to another, is more similar to the destination modality than the origin one.

29228920",Early Referral to Nephrological Care and the Uptake of Peritoneal Dialysis. An Analysis of German Claims Data.,"Hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) are medically equivalent alternatives for symptomatic therapy of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). An early referral (ER) of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to a nephrological specialist is associated with a higher proportion of patients choosing PD. Germany historically shows a low PD uptake. This article is the first investigation into the impact of ER on the uptake of PD, using a large German claims database.
Claims data of 4727 incident dialysis patients in 2015 and 2016 were analyzed. Accounting codes for nephrological care and dialysis modalities were identified. Their first documentation was defined as their first encounter with a nephrologist and their first dialysis treatment (HD or PD). ER was determined as receiving nephrological care at least six months before the first dialysis. A multivariate logistic regression model with adjusted odds ratios (AOR) investigates the impact of ER, outpatient dialysis start, age, comorbidities, and sex on the chance for PD.
Forty-three percent were referred to the nephrologist six months before their first dialysis (ER). Single tests, as well as the adjusted multivariate logistic regression, highlighted that ER significantly increases the chance for PD. In the multivariate model, the uptake of PD was associated with ER (AOR = 3.05; 
ER of patients with CKD to a nephrologist increases PD uptake. It gives both nephrologists and patients enough time for patient education about different treatment options and can contribute to informed decisions about the dialysis treatment.","['claims data', 'early referral', 'hemodialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'pre-dialysis care', 'statutory health insurance', 'treatment choice']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-08-28,"[{'lastname': 'Schellartz', 'firstname': 'Isabell', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Health Care Research, Rhineland State Council, LVR-IVF, 51109 Cologne, Germany.\nFaculty of Human Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Medical Sociology Health Services Research and Rehabilitation Science (IMVR), University of Cologne, 50933 Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Mettang', 'firstname': 'Sunita', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Betriebskrankenkasse (BKK) Linde, 65187 Wiesbaden, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Shukri', 'firstname': 'Arim', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Health Economics and Clinical Epidemiology (IGKE), University of Cologne, 50935 Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Scholten', 'firstname': 'Nadine', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Human Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Medical Sociology Health Services Research and Rehabilitation Science (IMVR), University of Cologne, 50933 Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Pfaff', 'firstname': 'Holger', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Human Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Medical Sociology Health Services Research and Rehabilitation Science (IMVR), University of Cologne, 50933 Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Mettang', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Center Wiesbaden, 65191 Wiesbaden, Germany.'}]",None,None,"Forty-three percent were referred to the nephrologist six months before their first dialysis (ER).

16009791",Prediction of mortality among patients with chronic kidney disease: A systematic review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common medical condition that is increasing in prevalence. Existing published evidence has revealed through regression analyses that several clinical characteristics are associated with mortality in CKD patients. However, the predictive accuracies of these risk factors for mortality have not been clearly demonstrated.
To demonstrate the accuracy of mortality predictive factors in CKD patients by utilizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) analysis.
We searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for eligible articles through January 2021. Studies were included based on the following criteria: (1) Study nature was observational or conference abstract; (2) Study populations involved patients with non-transplant CKD at any CKD stage severity; and (3) Predictive factors for mortality were presented with AUC analysis and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI). AUC of 0.70-0.79 is considered acceptable, 0.80-0.89 is considered excellent, and more than 0.90 is considered outstanding.
Of 1759 citations, a total of 18 studies (

312,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34419333,Physical exercise and peritoneal dialysis: An area yet to be explored.,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) is profoundly impaired by their frailty, disability and decreased physical capacity. Especially among older patients, a high prevalence of low physical activity levels and reduced functional performance has been reported. Physical exercise training has been shown to have a beneficial impact, counteracting these same hazardous consequences of inactivity and sedentarism both on CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients on hemodialysis (HD) treatment. The evidence-based knowledge on the effects of physical exercise on ESKD patients undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) treatment is scarce, even though this is a continually growing population that shares the same risk factors and desired clinical outcomes as the previously mentioned groups of patients. Further investigation will be necessary to clarify whether this exercise-based approach may be suitable for the PD population. This paper's purpose is to review the available literature, including randomized controlled trials, reviews and meta-analysis results that assessed the impact of physical exercise on patients under PD treatment bearing in mind their HRQoL, physical functioning and cardiovascular parameters. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate the perceived significant barriers and limitations of the PD population in what concerns physical exercise practice and how nephrologists should address them.","['Actividad física', 'Calidad de vida relacionada con la salud', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Diálisis peritoneal', 'Ejercicio físico', 'Enfermedad renal crónica', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Physical activity', 'Physical exercise']",Nefrologia,2021-08-23,"[{'lastname': 'Maia Neves Menezes', 'firstname': 'José Inacio', 'initials': 'JI', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Medicine of University of Porto, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Lopes Pereira', 'firstname': 'Luciano Artur', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Investigation and Innovation in Health, University of Porto, Portugal; INEB - National Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Porto, Portugal; Department of Nephrology, São João Hospital Center, Porto, Portugal.

The guideline is extremely welcomed by the Renal Association and it offers huge value to patients, clinicians, commissioners and key stakeholders. It overlaps and enhances current guidance published by the Renal Association including ""Haemodialysis"" (Clinical practice guideline: Haemodialysis; 2019) which was updated in 2019 after the publication of the NICE guideline, ""Peritoneal Dialysis in Adults and Children"" (Clinical practice guideline: peritoneal Dialysis in adults and children; 2017) and ""Planning, Initiation & withdrawal of Renal Replacement Therapy"" (Clinical practice guideline: planning, initiation and withdrawal of renal replacement therapy; 2014) (at present there are no plans to update this guideline). There are several strengths to NICE guideline NG107 and we agree with and support the vast majority of recommendation statements in the guideline.

23157936",Population pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics of fondaparinux in dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients undergoing chronic renal replacement therapy.,"Data on the anti-Xa efficacy of fondaparinux in dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (DD-CKD) patients are scarce. This study characterizes the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of fondaparinux in DD-CKD patients undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT), to assess dosing strategies.
A retrospective, observational study was conducted using data on anti-Xa activity (112 samples) from 12 (3 male and 9 female) DD-CKD patients (median (IQR) age 71 years (63-88), weight 73 kg (59-98.5)). Eleven patients underwent high-flux or low-flux hemodialysis (HD) and one patient underwent peritoneal dialysis. Three patients were also treated with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). A non-linear mixed effects analysis was performed using NONMEM 7.3.0.
The lab-specific slope of the relationship between fondaparinux concentration and anti-Xa levels was 1.18 IU/µg. In a one-compartment model, clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) were 0.05289 L/h and 5.55 L, respectively. High-flux HD was found to increase the CL of fondaparinux 2.26 times. TPE also considerably increased CL, but the fold-change could not be accurately estimated. Low-flux HD and peritoneal dialysis did not impact PK parameters.
Model-based simulations showed that standard dosing (2.5 mg three times weekly before HD) results in a median anti-Xa activity of 0.55 IU/mL and 0.98 IU/mL, pre- and post-low-flux HD, respectively. In patients undergoing high-flux HD, these values are approximately 27% lower. Additional caution is warranted with TPE, as this treatment can reduce anti-Xa activity even further.","['Fondaparinux', 'Hemodialysis', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Population pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics', 'Therapeutic plasma exchange']",European journal of clinical pharmacology,2021-08-21,"[{'lastname': 'Michaličková', 'firstname': 'Danica', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pharmacology, First Faculty of Medicine & General University Hospital, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic. marrtta@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Hartinger', 'firstname': 'Jan Miroslav', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pharmacology, First Faculty of Medicine & General University Hospital, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Hladinová', 'firstname': 'Zuzana', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Bednářová', 'firstname': 'Vladimíra', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Szonowská', 'firstname': 'Barbora', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Internal Department of Strahov, General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Polakovič', 'firstname': 'Vladimír', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Internal Department of Strahov, General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Matthios', 'firstname': 'Andreas', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pharmacology, First Faculty of Medicine & General University Hospital, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.\nDepartment of Biophysics and Physical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Charles University, Hradec Králové, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Tesař', 'firstname': 'Vladimír', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Slanař', 'firstname': 'Ondřej', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pharmacology, First Faculty of Medicine & General University Hospital, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.'}, {'lastname': 'Krekels', 'firstname': 'Elke H J', 'initials': 'EHJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Systems Biomedicine and Pharmacology, Leiden Academic Centre for Drug Research, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands.'}]",None,None,"The lab-specific slope of the relationship between fondaparinux concentration and anti-Xa levels was 1.18 IU/µg.

315,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34402785,Survival and mortality analysis in two nephrology centers: A prospective observational study.,"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) requiring dialysis therapy is increasing globally. Survival and mortality data of these patients in Germany are fragmentary since the nationwide registry was terminated in 2006.
The objective of this study was to analyze the survival, causes of death, and co-morbidities of dialysis patients in a German population cohort as well as to assess the factors influencing mortality in these patients.
We included adult, prevalent chronic dialysis patients from the German population who underwent hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis at our centers between 2014 and 2018. We compared the characteristics of living and deceased patients and assessed survival. Patients with and without diabetes mellitus were also examined, and their co-morbidities were analyzed.
Of the 425 patients included in our study (m/f: 235/190), 182 died within the observation period. Mean survival of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 217), peripheral artery disease (PAD) (n = 128), and cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) (n = 99) was significantly reduced compared to patients without the disease (CAD: 4.2 vs. 6.4 years; PAD: 4.3 vs. 6.5 years; CRS: 3.7 vs. 7.3 years, p < 0.001, respectively). Patients with diabetes mellitus (n = 110) showed no reduced survival compared to patients without the disease (n = 315) (4.8 vs. 4.9 years, p = 0.421). Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were associated with dialysis time in linear regression analysis (DBP: R = 0.029, p < 0,001; CRP: R = 0.085, p < 0.001).

Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) represent a relatively new technology for treatment of advanced heart failure. Kidney dysfunction, if present, makes candidate selection for LVADs challenging and contributes to multiple complications while the patients are on an LVAD support. Although kidney function generally improves after LVAD implantation, some patients develop acute and then chronic kidney disease sometimes requiring kidney replacement therapies (KRTs). Overall, chronic KRT in LVAD recipients is feasible and well tolerated, but routine technique of blood pressure monitoring should be adjusted to the continuous blood flow. Both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis can be used. Unique challenges for chronic KRT posed by the presence of LVAD are discussed in this review.","['Chronic KRT', 'Heart failure', 'Hemodialysis', 'Kidney failure', 'LVAD']",Advances in chronic kidney disease,2021-08-15,"[{'lastname': 'Jawaid', 'firstname': 'Omar', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Krannert Institute of Cardiology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN.'}, {'lastname': 'Gaddy', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN.'}, {'lastname': 'Omar', 'firstname': 'Hesham R', 'initials': 'HR', 'affiliation': 'Online Care Group (AmericanWell.com), Chicago, IL Online Care Group (AmericanWell.com), Chicago, IL.'}, {'lastname': 'Guglin', 'firstname': 'Maya', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Krannert Institute of Cardiology, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN.

30031446",Ongoing Exposure to Peritoneal Dialysis Fluid Alters Resident Peritoneal Macrophage Phenotype and Activation Propensity.,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a more continuous alternative to haemodialysis, for patients with chronic kidney disease, with considerable initial benefits for survival, patient independence and healthcare costs. However, long-term PD is associated with significant pathology, negating the positive effects over haemodialysis. Importantly, peritonitis and activation of macrophages is closely associated with disease progression and treatment failure. However, recent advances in macrophage biology suggest opposite functions for macrophages of different cellular origins. While monocyte-derived macrophages promote disease progression in some models of fibrosis, tissue resident macrophages have rather been associated with protective roles. Thus, we aimed to identify the relative contribution of tissue resident macrophages to PD induced inflammation in mice. Unexpectedly, we found an incremental loss of homeostatic characteristics, anti-inflammatory and efferocytic functionality in peritoneal resident macrophages, accompanied by enhanced inflammatory responses to external stimuli. Moreover, presence of glucose degradation products within the dialysis fluid led to markedly enhanced inflammation and almost complete disappearance of tissue resident cells. Thus, alterations in tissue resident macrophages may render long-term PD patients sensitive to developing peritonitis and consequently fibrosis/sclerosis.","['fibrosis', 'glucose degradation product', 'inflammation', 'macrophage', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'tissue resident']",Frontiers in immunology,2021-08-14,"[{'lastname': 'Sutherland', 'firstname': 'Tara E', 'initials': 'TE', 'affiliation': 'Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Division of Infection, Immunity and Respiratory Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.\nManchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research (MCCIR), University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.\nWellcome Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Shaw', 'firstname': 'Tovah N', 'initials': 'TN', 'affiliation': 'Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Division of Infection, Immunity and Respiratory Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.\nManchester Collaborative Centre for Inflammation Research (MCCIR), University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.\nInstitute of Immunology and Infection Research, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Lennon', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Wellcome Centre for Cell-Matrix Research, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.\nDivision of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Herrick', 'firstname': 'Sarah E', 'initials': 'SE', 'affiliation': 'Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Division of Infection, Immunity and Respiratory Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.\nDivision of Cell Matrix Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Faculty of Biology Medicine and Health, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Rückerl', 'firstname': 'Dominik', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Lydia Becker Institute of Immunology and Inflammation, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, Division of Infection, Immunity and Respiratory Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2021 Sutherland, Shaw, Lennon, Herrick and Rückerl.","10.3389/fimmu.2021.715209

31116348",Isolated Penile Calciphylaxis Diagnosed by Ultrasound Imaging in a New Dialysis Patient: A Case Report.,"The recognition of calciphylaxis often eludes practitioners because of its multiple ambiguous presentations. It classically targets areas of the body dense with adipose tissue. A heightened suspicion for the disorder is therefore required in the case of penile calciphylaxis, given its unconventional location. The diagnosis of calciphylaxis is also challenging as the gold standard for diagnosis is biopsy which can often yield equivocal results. Unfortunately, in penile calciphylaxis, the utility of biopsies is further debated due to their potential to precipitate new lesions and their decreased sensitivity due to the limited depth of tissue that can be sampled. For these reasons, it is important that practitioners recognize other accessible and accurate investigative tools which can aid in their diagnosis.
We present the case of a 49-year-old man who presented to the emergency room with penile pain in the context of known chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy. The pain had been present for about a week, was exquisitely tender, and was initially associated with a faint violaceous lesion. This gentleman had just recently initiated peritoneal dialysis and had no other lesions on his body.
His pain was determined by ultrasound and plain radiograph to be secondary to calciphylaxis after two biopsies were nondiagnostic.
The patient had already made changes to his diet to reduce phosphate and calcium intake, and had been on phosphate-lowering therapy with both calcium and phosphate being within their respective target range. Following his diagnosis, this patient was promptly converted from peritoneal dialysis to hemodialysis with sodium thiosulphate and initiated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This patient continues to be followed by nephrology and urology specialists.
At the time of publication there has been no amputation of the appendage although there has been presumably permanent loss of function.
This case should reinforce the high index of suspicion needed to make a timely diagnosis of calciphylaxis, and the broad variety of ways in which the disorder may present. The findings advocate for the utility of alternative diagnostic modalities, including imaging with plain radiograph and ultrasound, for calciphylaxis diagnosis.
Les multiples présentations cliniques de la calciphylaxie, une affection qui cible habituellement des régions du corps denses en tissu adipeux, font en sorte que sa détection échappe fréquemment aux praticiens. La calciphylaxie pénienne, en raison de son emplacement inhabituel, devrait faire l’objet d’une suspicion clinique accrue. La calciphylaxie est en outre difficile à diagnostiquer puisque la biopsie, l’étalon-or pour sa détection, mène souvent à des résultats équivoques. Dans le cas de la calciphylaxie pénienne, la pertinence de la biopsie fait d’autant plus débat puisqu’elle est susceptible de précipiter de nouvelles lésions et qu’elle présente une sensibilité réduite compte tenu de la profondeur limitée des tissus pouvant être obtenus. Il est donc important que les praticiens connaissent d’autres outils d’investigation accessibles et plus précis pouvant les aider dans leur diagnostic.
Nous présentons le cas d’un homme de 49 ans s’étant présenté aux urgences avec une douleur au pénis. Le patient était connu pour une insuffisance rénale chronique découlant d’une néphropathie diabétique. La douleur, initialement associée à une lésion légèrement violacée, était présente depuis environ une semaine et le membre était extrêmement sensible. Le patient venait tout juste d’amorcer des traitements de dialyze péritonéale et ne présentait aucune autre lésion sur le corps.
Après deux biopsies non diagnostiques, une échographie et une radiographie standard ont permis d’associer la douleur à la calciphylaxie.
Le patient avait déjà apporté des changements à son alimentation afin de réduire son apport en phosphore et en calcium, et recevait déjà un traitement de chélateur de phosphate. Les taux de calcium et de phosphore se situaient dans leur plage cible respective. À la suite du diagnostic, le patient est rapidement passé de la dialyze péritonéale à l’hémodialyse, a été traité avec du thiosulfate de sodium et a entrepris une oxygénothérapie hyperbare. Le patient continue d’être suivi par des spécialistes en néphrologie et en urologie.
Au moment de la publication, le patient n’avait toujours pas subi d’amputation, malgré une vraisemblable perte de fonction permanente.
Ce cas devrait renforcer l’indice élevé de suspicion qui est nécessaire pour poser rapidement un diagnostic de calciphylaxie, en plus de montrer les très nombreuses présentations cliniques de ce trouble. Ces résultats plaident en faveur de modalités alternatives pour le diagnostic de la calciphylaxie, notamment le recours à l’échographie et à la radiographie standard.","['calciphylaxis', 'diagnosis', 'penile', 'radiograph', 'ultrasound']",Canadian journal of kidney health and disease,2021-08-10,"[{'lastname': 'Helmeczi', 'firstname': 'Wryan', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Pitre', 'firstname': 'Tyler', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Hudson', 'firstname': 'Emma', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Department of Family Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Mondhe', 'firstname': 'Suhas', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Burns', 'firstname': 'Kevin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, University of Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}]",None,None,None,"© The Author(s) 2021.

Sarcopenia and protein-energy wasting syndrome are also associated with mortality. The aim was to assess the relationship between vascular calcification, sarcopenia, and protein-energy wasting syndrome (PEW) in automated peritoneal dialysis patients. Fifty-one maintenance automated peritoneal dialysis patients were included (27 were male, mean age 39 ± 14 years). Vascular calcification was assessed based on abdomen, pelvis, and hand radiographs. Sarcopenia was assessed with bioimpedance analysis and a hand grip strength test. The Malnutrition-Inflammation Score and the presence of PEW were also assessed. Vascular calcification was present in 21 patients (41.2%).

30026783",Oxidative Stress in Patients with Advanced CKD and Renal Replacement Therapy: The Key Role of Peripheral Blood Leukocytes.,"Oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Most studies have investigated peripheral redox state focus on plasma, but not in different immune cells. Our study analyzed several redox state markers in plasma and isolated peripheral polymorphonuclear (PMNs) and mononuclear (MNs) leukocytes from advanced-CKD patients, also evaluating differences of hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) procedures. Antioxidant (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH)) and oxidant parameters (xanthine oxidase (XO), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), malondialdehyde (MDA)) were assessed in plasma, PMNs and MNs from non-dialysis-dependent-CKD (NDD-CKD), HD and PD patients and healthy controls. Increased oxidative stress and damage were observed in plasma, PMNs and MNs from NDD-CKD, HD and PD patients (increased XO, GSSG and MDA; decreased SOD, CAT, GPX and GSH; altered GSSG/GSH balance). Several oxidative alterations were more exacerbated in PMNs, whereas others were only observed in MNs. Dialysis procedures had a positive effect on preserving the GSSG/GSH balance in PMNs. Interestingly, PD patients showed greater oxidative stress than HD patients, especially in MNs. The assessment of redox state parameters in PMNs and MNs could have potential use as biomarkers of the CKD progression.","['chronic kidney disease', 'hemodialysis', 'mononuclear leukocytes', 'oxidative stress', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'polymorphonuclear leukocytes']","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-08-07,"[{'lastname': 'Vida', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics, Physiology and Microbiology (Unit of Animal Physiology), Faculty of Biology, University Complutense of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.\nResearch Institute Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), 28041 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Oliva', 'firstname': 'Carlos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics, Physiology and Microbiology (Unit of Animal Physiology), Faculty of Biology, University Complutense of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Yuste', 'firstname': 'Claudia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), 28041 Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, 28041 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ceprián', 'firstname': 'Noemí', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics, Physiology and Microbiology (Unit of Animal Physiology), Faculty of Biology, University Complutense of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.\nResearch Institute Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), 28041 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Caro', 'firstname': 'Paula Jara', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), 28041 Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, 28041 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Valera', 'firstname': 'Gemma', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics, Physiology and Microbiology (Unit of Animal Physiology), Faculty of Biology, University Complutense of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'González de Pablos', 'firstname': 'Ignacio', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), 28041 Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, 28041 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Morales', 'firstname': 'Enrique', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Research Institute Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), 28041 Madrid, Spain.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, 28041 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Carracedo', 'firstname': 'Julia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Genetics, Physiology and Microbiology (Unit of Animal Physiology), Faculty of Biology, University Complutense of Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.\nResearch Institute Hospital 12 de Octubre (imas12), 28041 Madrid, Spain.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/antiox10071155

322,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34355679,A Meta-analysis on the Relationship between Different Dialysis Modalities and Depression in End-stage Renal Disease Patients.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between different dialysis modalities and depression in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.
We searched through the PsycINFO, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CNKI for all related studies from 1 January 1990 through 30 June 2019 without restriction on language. We selected papers that compared depression levels among patients undergoing hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Two authors independently selected studies, evaluated the quality of included studies, and extracted data according to Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). A discussion with a third author checked any disagreement to minimize the publication bias. PRISMA guidelines were used as the standards of reporting (PRISMA registration ID is 239172).
There was insufficient evidence to prove the relationship between different dialysis modalities and depression (OR: 2.37, 95% CI: 0.88-6.40).

33486718",Population pharmacokinetics of roxadustat in Japanese dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease patients with anaemia.,"Our objective was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model to describe roxadustat plasma concentrations in Japanese dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (DD-CKD) patients with renal anaemia and to identify the covariate factors that affect exposure of roxadustat.
In total, 367 patients (male, 256; female, 111) contributing 1285 concentration values from 4 clinical studies were analysed using a nonlinear mixed-effects modelling approach. Candidate covariates included clinical characteristics hypothesized to affect roxadustat clearance and bioavailability, such as demographics, hepatic parameters and concomitant drugs.
The roxadustat PK data in Japanese DD-CKD patients with renal anaemia were well described by a 2-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and interindividual variability on clearance, central volume of distribution and absorption rate constant. Age was identified as a significant covariate on clearance. PK profiles of haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients were comparable. Eighty-two percent of patients were administered at least 1 phosphate binder (PB). The effect of PBs on roxadustat concentration was modelled as a decrease in bioavailability. Staggered administration of PBs reduced the effect on roxadustat bioavailability. The clinical impact of all covariates on roxadustat PK was mild and manageable as the roxadustat dose was titrated based on haemoglobin level and administered starting from a low dose.
Roxadustat PK in Japanese DD-CKD patients were successfully described by a population PK model. The identified key covariates included coadministration of PBs on the roxadustat bioavailability and age on clearance of roxadustat.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'drug interactions', 'pharmacokinetics']",British journal of clinical pharmacology,2021-08-06,"[{'lastname': 'Takada', 'firstname': 'Akitsugu', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc., Illinois, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shibata', 'firstname': 'Tomohisa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Astellas Pharma, Inc., Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shiga', 'firstname': 'Takanori', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Astellas Pharma, Inc., Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Groenendaal-van de Meent', 'firstname': 'Dorien', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Astellas Pharma Europe B.V, Leiden, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Komatsu', 'firstname': 'Kanji', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Astellas Pharma, Inc., Tokyo, Japan.'}]",None,Roxadustat PK in Japanese DD-CKD patients were successfully described by a population PK model.

19326414",Peritoneal Dialysis After Liver Transplantation: A Systematic Review.,"Chronic kidney disease following liver transplantation is a major long-term complication. Most liver transplant recipients with kidney failure will be treated with dialysis instead of kidney transplantation due to noneligibility and shortage in organ availability. In this population, the role of peritoneal dialysis (PD) as a modality of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) remains unclear.
To determine the feasibility regarding safety, technique survival, and dialysis efficiency of PD in liver transplant recipients requiring KRT for maintenance dialysis.
Systematic review.
Interventional and observational studies reporting the use of PD after liver transplantation.
Adult liver transplant recipients with kidney failure treated with maintenance KRT.
Extracted data included eligibility criteria, study design, demographics, and PD modality. The following outcomes of interest were extracted: rate of peritonitis and microorganisms involved, noninfectious peritoneal complications, technique survival, and kidney transplantation-censored technique survival. Non-PD complications included overall survival, liver graft dysfunction, and hospitalization rate.
The following databases were searched until July 2020: MedLine/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently screening all titles and abstracts of all identified articles. Due to the limited sample size, observational designs and study heterogeneity expected, no meta-analysis was pre-planned. Descriptive statistics were used to report all results.
From the 5263 identified studies, 4 were included in the analysis as they reported at least 1 outcome of interest on a total of 21 liver transplant recipients, with an overall follow-up duration on PD of 19.0 (Interquartile range [IQR]: 9.5-29.5) months. Fifteen episodes of peritonitis occurred in a total cumulative PD follow-up of 514 patient-months, representing an incidence rate of 0.35 per year. These episodes did not result in PD technique failure, mortality, or impairment of liver graft function.
Limitations include the paucity of studies in the field and the small number of patients included in each report, a risk of publication bias and the impossibility to directly compare hemodialysis to PD in this population. These results, therefore, must be interpreted with caution.
Based on limited data reporting the feasibility of PD in liver transplant recipients with kidney failure, no signal was associated with an increased risk of infectious complications. Long-term studies evaluating this modality need to be performed.

L’insuffisance rénale chronique est une complication majeure à long terme survenant après une transplantation hépatique. La plupart des transplantés du foie qui développent une insuffisance rénale seront traités par dialyze plutôt que par une greffe rénale; En raison de la pénurie d’organes et par non-éligibilité à la greffe rénale, la plupart des transplantés du foie qui developpent une insuffisance rénale avancée seront traités par dialyse. L’importance de la dialyse péritonéale (DP) comme modalité de remplacement rénal demeure toutefois inconnue dans cette population de patients.
Étudier la faisabilité de la DP en matière d’innocuité, d’efficacité et de survie de la technique chez les receveurs d’une greffe hépatique qui nécessitent une thérapie de remplacement rénal comme dialyse d’entretien.
Revue systématique.
Les études interventionnelles et observationnelles signalant l’utilisation de la DP après une transplantation hépatique.
Des adultes ayant subi une transplantation hépatique et dont l’insuffisance rénale secondaire est traitée par thérapie de remplacement rénal.
Les données extraites comprenaient les critères d’admissibilité, la méthodologie de l’étude, les caractéristiques démographiques des sujets et la modalité de DP. Les résultats d’intérêt suivants ont été extraits : le taux de péritonites et les microorganismes impliqués, les complications péritonéales non infectieuses, la survie de la technique et la survie de la technique censurée par la transplantation rénale. Les complications non liées à la DP comprenaient la survie globale, la défaillance du greffon hépatique et le taux d’hospitalisation.
Les bases de données Medline/PubMed, Embase, CINAHL et Cochrane Library ont été consultées jusqu’en juillet 2020. Deux réviseurs indépendants ont examiné les titres et résumés de tous les articles recensés. Aucune méta-analyse n’a été planifiée en raison de la nature observationnelle et de l’hétérogénéité attendue des études retenues, et de la faible taille de l’échantillon. Des statistiques descriptives ont été utilisées pour présenter les données.
Des 5263 études recensées, seules quatre ont été incluses dans l’analyse, rapportant un total de 21 transplantés hépatiques, dont la durée médiane sur DP s’établissait à 19.0 mois (IIQ: 95 à 29.5). Au cours d’un suivi cumulatif de 514 mois-patients sur DP, 15 épisodes de péritonite ont été observés, soit un taux d’incidence de 0,35 par année. Ces épisodes n’ont pas entraîné d’échec de la DP, ni de mortalité ou d’altération de la fonction du greffon hépatique.
Les limites comprennent le manque d’études sur le sujet, le faible nombre de patients inclus dans chaque rapport, un risque de biais de publication et l’impossibilité de comparer directement l’hémodialyse à la DP dans cette population. Les résultats doivent ainsi être interprétés avec prudence.
Selon les données limitées portant sur la faisabilité de la dialyse péritonéale chez les receveurs d’une greffe hépatique atteints d’insuffisance rénale, aucun signal notable n’est associé à un risque accru de complications infectieuses.

In the absence of contraindications, increasing continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) use may be an attractive option for Indonesia to reduce the high costs of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) treatment. The implementation of CAPD in Indonesia faces several challenges, including the cost of PD, the unique archipelagic geography, limited facilities and trained medical personnel in rural areas, inadequate reimbursement rates and incentive fees, high rates of PD discontinuation, as well as insufficient knowledge regarding CAPD by the general public and health professionals. Changes in the policy of medical service incentive fees and improvements in the national health insurance system regulation over CAPD may improve the utilization of PD for ESKD patients in Indonesia. Nationwide promotional and preventive efforts on chronic kidney disease, dialysis modality education and establishment of PD training programs for medical professionals are necessary.","['CAPD', 'Indonesia', 'end-stage kidney disease', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,2021-08-03,"[{'lastname': 'Jonny', 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Nephrology Division, Gatot Soebroto Indonesia Army Central Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia.'}, {'lastname': 'Violetta', 'firstname': 'Laurencia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Nephrology Division, Gatot Soebroto Indonesia Army Central Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia.'}, {'lastname': 'Kusumaningrum', 'firstname': 'Venna Febrian', 'initials': 'VF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Nephrology Division, Gatot Soebroto Indonesia Army Central Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia.'}]",None,None,None,None,10.1177/08968608211034985,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x288026520>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,34338050,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34338050,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

Bevezetés: A krónikus vesebetegség tünetei, a kezelés sajátosságai nagymértékben korlátozzák a páciensek mindennapi életvitelét, hatással vannak testi és lelki egészségükre, és nehezítik társas kapcsolataikat. Célkitűzések: A jelen kutatás célja a magyar dializált betegpopuláció egészségműveltségének, életminőségének és betegségterhének megismerése, továbbá a kezelési típusok hatását kívántuk felmérni a fent említett pszichológiai tényezők mentén. Módszer: A vizsgálatban 42 krónikus dializált személy vett részt: 31 hemodializált és 11 hasi dialízist végző vesebeteg. Átlagéletkoruk 63,33 ± 12,92 év. A minta életkor, nemi eloszlás és családi állapot alapján reprezentatív. Kérdőíves technikával mértük a betegek életminőségét, egészségműveltségét és betegségterhét. Eredmények: Eredményeink szerint a peritonealis dialízist végző betegek szignifikánsan magasabb egészségműveltséggel rendelkeznek, mint hemodializált betegtársaik. Ez a jelentős különbség az életminőségük több területén is kimutatható volt. Következtetés: Eredményeink a betegedukáció és a kezelőszemélyzettől kapott támogatás (bátorítás) jelentőségére hívják fel a figyelmet. A betegoktatás a hemodializált betegcsoport esetében is kiemelten fontos. A klinikai szempontból hasznos intervenciós javaslatokat fogalmaztunk meg, melyek célzottan az egészségműveltség fejlesztésére irányulnak. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(30): 1208-1215.
The symptoms of chronic kidney disease, the peculiarities of the treatment greatly limit the patients' daily life, affect their physical and mental health and make their social relationships more difficult.
The purpose of this research is to explore the health literacy, the health-related quality of life and illness intrusiveness of Hungarian dialysis patients. Furthermore, we wanted to assess the effect of treatment types along the psychological factors mentioned above.
The sample consisted of 42 patients with chronic kidney disease, 31 of whom have hemodialysis and 11 have peritoneal dialysis treatment. Their mean age was 63.33 ±12.92 years. The sample is representative by age, gender, and marital status. We measured the health-related quality of life, the health literacy and illness intrusiveness of the patients using special questionnaire techniques.
The peritoneal dialysis patients have significantly higher health literacy than their hemodialysis counterparts. This significant difference was seen in several areas of their quality of life as well.
Our results draw attention to the importance of patient education and the special support by the treatment staff. The patient education for the haemodialysis group is of paramount importance for the hemodialysis group, too.

8576769","Health literacy level in a various nephrology population from Québec: predialysis clinic, in-centre hemodialysis and home dialysis; a transversal monocentric observational study.","Health literacy refers to the ability of individuals to gain access to, use, and understand health information and services in order to maintain a good health. It is especially important in nephrology due to the complexity of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present study sought to define health literacy levels in patients followed in predialysis clinic, in-center dialysis (ICHD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and home hemodialysis (HHD).
This transversal monocentric observational study analysed 363 patients between October 2016 and April 2017. The Brief Health Literacy Screen (BHLS) and the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) were used to measure health literacy. Multivariate linear regressions were used to compare the mean scores on the BHLS and HLQ, across the four groups.
Patients on PD had a significantly higher BHLS'score than patients on ICHD (p = 0.04). HLQ's scores differed across the groups: patients on HHD (p = 0.01) and PD (p = 0.002) were more likely to feel understood by their healthcare providers. Compared to ICHD, patients on HHD were more likely to have sufficient information to manage their health (p = 0.02), and patients in the predialysis clinic were more likely to report high abilities for health information appraisal (p < 0.001).
In a monocentric study, there is a significant proportion of CKD patients, especially in predialysis clinic and in-centre hemodialysis, with limited health literacy. Patients on home dialysis (HHD and PD) had a higher level of health literacy compared to the other groups.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'Health literacy', 'Hemodialysis', 'Peritoneal dialysis']",BMC nephrology,2021-07-11,"[{'lastname': 'Boyer', 'firstname': 'Annabel', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""CHU de Queébec Research Center, L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec Hospital, Québec, QC, Canada. annabel.boyer@wanadoo.fr.\nDivision of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada. annabel.boyer@wanadoo.fr.\nCentre Universitaire des Maladies Rénales, CHU de Caen, 14033, Caen Cedex 9, France. annabel.boyer@wanadoo.fr.""}, {'lastname': 'Begin', 'firstname': 'Yannick', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""CHU de Queébec Research Center, L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec Hospital, Québec, QC, Canada.\nDivision of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Dupont', 'firstname': 'Julie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Nurse practitioner, CHU de Québec-Université Laval Nursing Department, L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec Hospital, Québec, QC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Rousseau-Gagnon', 'firstname': 'Mathieu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""CHU de Queébec Research Center, L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec Hospital, Québec, QC, Canada.\nDivision of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Fernandez', 'firstname': 'Nicolas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine and Emergency Medicine, Université de Montréal, Québec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Demian', 'firstname': 'Maryam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Simonyan', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Clinical and Evaluative Research Platform, CHU de Québec-Université Laval Research Center, Québec, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Agharazii', 'firstname': 'Mohsen', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""CHU de Queébec Research Center, L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec Hospital, Québec, QC, Canada.\nDivision of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Mac-Way', 'firstname': 'Fabrice', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""CHU de Queébec Research Center, L'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec Hospital, Québec, QC, Canada.\nDivision of Nephrology, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Québec, QC, Canada.""}]",None,"In a monocentric study, there is a significant proportion of CKD patients, especially in predialysis clinic and in-centre hemodialysis, with limited health literacy.

23432352",Information about different treatment options and shared decision making in dialysis care - a retrospective survey among hemodialysis patients.,"Hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) are equivalent treatment alternatives for patients with end stage renal disease. In Germany, there is a legal obligation to inform every patient about all treatment alternatives and their possible harms and benefits. However, there is a low utilization of PD. Therefore, the question arises, whether HD patients perceive that they were informed about different dialysis options. We further investigate, if personal characteristics of informed and non-informed patients vary, and if both groups experienced the decision for their dialysis treatment as shared decision making (SDM).
The database was a nationwide postal survey of 590 HD patients from two statutory health insurers in Germany. Participants were asked whether they have been informed about both dialysis options. A logistic regression model examines impact factors on this information. We investigate differences in the German version of the 9-item SDM Questionnaire (SDM-Q-9) between informed and non-informed patients with a multivariate linear regression model.
56 % of the respondents reported they had been informed about different dialysis treatment options. Patients older than 65 had a 61 % lower chance than patients ≤ 65 for this information (p < 0.001). High educated patients had a 47 % higher chance for this information than patients with low education level (p = 0.030). Informed patients rated a higher SDM-Q-9 scores than non-informed patients (76.9 vs. 44.2; p < 0.001). Non-informed patients showed high values in those SDM-Q-9 items which had no regard to different treatment options.
A great proportion of HD patients - mostly elderly patients and patients with a low education level - did not perceive that they were informed about different dialysis options before dialysis was initiated. The current obligation to provide information about all treatment alternatives in Germany is a first step to assure the unselected access to different treatment options. But it has not reached routine application in health care yet. Information about different treatment options can pave the way for SDM. While SDM is considered to be a valuable tool in clinical medicine, there is still room for improvement for its successful implementation when it comes to decision making on different dialysis treatment options.
The MAU-PD study (Multidimensional analysis of causes for the low prevalence of ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in Germany) is registered at the German Clinical Trials Register.

15899939",Association of blood pressure after peritoneal dialysis initiation with the decline rate of residual kidney function in newly-initiated peritoneal dialysis patients.,"Lower blood pressure (BP) levels are linked to a slower decline of kidney function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) without kidney replacement therapy. However, there are limited data on this relation in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Here we evaluated the association of BP levels with the decline of residual kidney function (RKF) in a retrospective cohort study.
We enrolled 228 patients whose PD was initiated between 1998 and 2014. RKF was measured as the average of creatinine and urea clearance in 24-hr urine collections. We calculated the annual decline rate of RKF by determining the regression line for individual patients. RKF is thought to decline exponentially, and thus we also calculated the annual decline rate of logarithmic scale of RKF (log RKF). We categorized the patients' BP levels at 3 months after PD initiation (BP3M) into four groups (Optimal, Normal & High normal, Grade 1 hypertension, Grade 2 & 3 hypertension) according to the 2018 European Society of Cardiology and European Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension.
The unadjusted, age- and sex-adjusted, and multivariable-adjusted decline rate of RKF and log RKF decreased significantly with higher BP3M levels (P for trend <0.01). Compared to those of the Optimal group, the multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for the faster side of the median decline rate of RKF and log RKF were 4.04 (1.24-13.2) and 5.50 (1.58-19.2) in the Grade 2 and 3 hypertension group, respectively (p<0.05).

333,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34233334,Volume Balance in Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation Methodologies and Innovation Opportunities.,"Patients affected by chronic kidney disease are at a risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Body fluids unbalance is one of the main characteristics of this condition, as fluid overload is highly prevalent in patients affected by the cardiorenal syndrome.
We describe the state of the art and new insights into body volume evaluation. The mechanisms behind fluid balance are often complex, mainly because of the interplay of multiple regulatory systems. Consequently, its management may be challenging in clinical practice and even more so out-of-hospital. Availability of novel technologies offer new opportunities to improve the quality of care and patients' outcome. Development and validation of new technologies could provide new tools to reduce costs for the healthcare system, promote personalized medicine, and boost home care. Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, a proper monitoring of chronic patients suffering from fluid unbalances is extremely relevant. Key Message: We discuss the main mechanisms responsible for fluid overload in different clinical contexts, including hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and heart failure, emphasizing the potential impact provided by the implementation of the new technologies.","['Body water', 'Chronic kidney failure', 'Electric impedance', 'Heart failure', 'Telemedicine']",Kidney & blood pressure research,2021-07-08,"[{'lastname': 'La Porta', 'firstname': 'Edoardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardionephrology, Istituto Clinico Di Alta Specialità (ICLAS), Rapallo, Italy.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine (DIMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Lanino', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine (DIMI), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Calatroni', 'firstname': 'Marta', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Caramella', 'firstname': 'Elena', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Ospedale Sant'Anna, San Fermo della Battaglia, Como, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Avella', 'firstname': 'Alessandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Dialysis, Ospedale di Circolo e Fondazione Macchi, Varese, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Quinn', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Faragli', 'firstname': 'Alessandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine and Cardiology, Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine and Cardiology, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.\nBerlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany.\nDZHK (German Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Partner Site Berlin, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Estienne', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Dialysis, SS.

29033051",Severe restless legs syndrome in a family with Alport syndrome.,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sleep-related movement disorder characterized by an urge to move the legs during inactivity, especially at evening-night. RLS is highly prevalent in patients with kidney failure and have an impact on quality of life, mood, sleep quality and overall on compliance to the dialysis. Alport syndrome (AS) is a rare inherited disease, predominantly X-linked, secondary to mutations in genes encoding α3, α4 or α5 chains of type IV collagen, and characterized by hematuria, chronic kidney disease, neurosensory deafness, and lenticonus.
Here we describe a family with a combination of X-linked AS and severe RLS accompanied by periodic limb movements during sleep (PLMS). In the first patient we identified, RLS was complicated by a paradoxical response to dopamine agonists named ""augmentation"", leading to sleep disruption, hallucinations and five peritoneal perforations during the peritoneal dialysis due to the difficulty to rest still. Therapeutic adjustments and renal transplantation improved RLS and PLMS. In two brothers, severe RLS prevented a compliance with hemodialysis. Female family members carrying the mutation were also affected by RLS, while those without the mutations were RLS-free.
RLS has not been reported earlier in association with AS, but the peculiar combinations observed in this family will stimulate further clinical studies and motivate nephrologists to seek for RLS symptoms and sleep disturbances in AS patients.","['Alport syndrome', 'Augmentation', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Restless legs syndrome']",BMC nephrology,2021-07-07,"[{'lastname': 'Sparasci', 'firstname': 'Davide', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Sleep Medicine Unit, Neurocenter of Southern Switzerland, Ospedale Civico, Lugano, Switzerland.

23823605",Real-world safety and effectiveness of sucroferric oxyhydroxide for treatment of hyperphosphataemia in dialysis patients: a prospective observational study.,"The iron-based phosphate binder (PB), sucroferric oxyhydroxide (SFOH), is indicated to control serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.
This non-interventional, prospective, multicentre, cohort study conducted in seven European countries evaluated the safety and effectiveness of SFOH in dialysis patients with hyperphosphataemia in routine practice. Safety outcomes included adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and changes in iron-related parameters. SFOH effectiveness was evaluated by changes-from-baseline (BL) in serum phosphorus and percentage of patients achieving in-target phosphorus levels.
The safety analysis set included 1365 patients (mean observation: 420.3 ± 239.3 days). Overall, 682 (50.0%) patients discontinued the study. Mean SFOH dose during the observation period was 1172.7 ± 539.9 mg (2.3 pills/day). Overall, 617 (45.2%) patients received concomitant PB(s) during SFOH treatment. ADRs and serious ADRs were observed for 531 (38.9%) and 26 (1.9%) patients. Most frequent ADRs were diarrhoea (194 patients, 14.2%) and discoloured faeces (128 patients, 9.4%). Diarrhoea generally occurred early during SFOH treatment and was mostly mild and transient. Small increases from BL in serum ferritin were observed (ranging from +12 to +75 µg/L). SFOH treatment was associated with serum phosphorus reductions (6.3 ± 1.6 mg/dL at BL versus 5.3 ± 1.8 mg/dL at Month 30; ΔBL: -1.0 mg/dL, P < 0.01). Percentage of patients achieving serum phosphorus ≤4.5 mg/dL increased from 12.0% at BL to 34.8% at Month 30, while the percentage achieving serum phosphorus ≤5.5 mg/dL increased from 29.9% to 63.0%.
SFOH has a favourable safety and tolerability profile in a real-world setting, consistent with results of the Phase 3 study. Moreover, SFOH improved serum phosphorus control with a low daily pill burden.","['chronic kidney disease', 'end-stage kidney disease', 'haemodialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'phosphate binder']",Clinical kidney journal,2021-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Vervloet', 'firstname': 'Marc G', 'initials': 'MG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences (ACS), Amsterdam University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Boletis', 'firstname': 'Ioannis N', 'initials': 'IN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Laiko General Hospital, National and Kapodistrian University, Athens, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'de Francisco', 'firstname': 'Angel L M', 'initials': 'ALM', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Service, Hospital Universitario Marqués de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Kalra', 'firstname': 'Philip A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Salford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ketteler', 'firstname': 'Markus', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Internal Medicine and Nephrology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.\nSchool of Medicine, University of Split, Split, Croatia.'}, {'lastname': 'Messa', 'firstname': 'Piergiorgio', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""Division of Nephrology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Milano, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Stauss-Grabo', 'firstname': 'Manuela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Clinical & Epidemiological Research, Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Derlet', 'firstname': 'Anja', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Clinical & Epidemiological Research, Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Walpen', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Affairs, Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma, Glattbrugg, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Perrin', 'firstname': 'Amandine', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medical Affairs, Vifor Fresenius Medical Care Renal Pharma, Glattbrugg, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ficociello', 'firstname': 'Linda H', 'initials': 'LH', 'affiliation': 'Fresenius Medical Care Renal Therapies Group, Waltham, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rottembourg', 'firstname': 'Jacques', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Wanner', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, University Hospital, Würzburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Cannata-Andía', 'firstname': 'Jorge B', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': 'Bone and Mineral Research Unit, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Instituto de Investigación del Principado de Asturias, Universidad de Oviedo, RedinRen, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Fouque', 'firstname': 'Denis', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, UCBL, CarMeN, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, University of Lyon, Lyon, France.'}]",None,None,"The safety analysis set included 1365 patients (mean observation: 420.3 ± 239.3 days).

32998808",Step-by-step guide to setting up a kidney replacement therapy registry: the challenge of a national kidney replacement therapy registry.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has become one of the most important public health problems worldwide. Analysis, and understanding, of this global/national/regional reality would benefit from renal registry databases. The implementation of a CKD registry (including all categories) is difficult to achieve, given its high cost. On the other hand, patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are easily accessible and constitute the most severe subgroup in terms of comorbidities and healthcare costs. A kidney replacement therapy registry (KRTR) is defined as the systematic and continuous collection of a population-based data set from ESKD patients treated by dialysis/kidney transplant. The lack of available data, particularly in emerging economies, leaves information gaps on healthcare and outcomes in these patients. The heterogeneity/absence of a KRTR in some countries is consistent with the inequities in access to KRT worldwide. In 2014, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) proposed to determine the prevalence of patients on dialysis for at least 700 patients per million inhabitants by 2019 in every Latin American (LA) country. Since then, PAHO and the Sociedad LatinoAmericana de Nefrología e Hipertensión have provided training courses and certification of KRTR in LA. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide guidance on how to set up a new KRTR in countries or regions that still lack one. Advice is provided on the sequential steps in the process of setting up a KRTR, personnel requirements, data set content and minimum quality indicators required.","['chronic kidney disease', 'epidemiology', 'hemodialysis', 'kidney transplantation', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Clinical kidney journal,2021-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Rosa-Diez', 'firstname': 'Guillermo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Latin American Dialysis and Renal Transplantation Registry (RLADTR), Montevideo, Uruguay.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'González-Bedat', 'firstname': 'María Carlota', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Latin American Dialysis and Renal Transplantation Registry (RLADTR), Montevideo, Uruguay.\nSociedad Latinoamericana de Nefrología e Hipertensión.

33188362",Fighting the unbearable lightness of neglecting kidney health: the decade of the kidney.,"A brief comprehensive overview is provided of the elements constituting the burden of kidney disease [chronic kidney disease (CKD) and acute kidney injury]. This publication can be used for advocacy, emphasizing the importance and urgency of reducing this heavy and rapidly growing burden. Kidney diseases contribute to significant physical limitations, loss of quality of life, emotional and cognitive disorders, social isolation and premature death. CKD affects close to 100 million Europeans, with 300 million being at risk, and is projected to become the fifth cause of worldwide death by 2040. Kidney disease also imposes financial burdens, given the costs of accessing healthcare and inability to work. The extrapolated annual cost of all CKD is at least as high as that for cancer or diabetes. In addition, dialysis treatment of kidney diseases imposes environmental burdens by necessitating high energy and water consumption and producing plastic waste. Acute kidney injury is associated with further increases in global morbidity, mortality and economic burden. Yet investment in research for treatment of kidney disease lags behind that of other diseases. This publication is a call for European investment in research for kidney health. The innovations generated should mirror the successful European Union actions against cancer over the last 30 years. It is also a plea to nephrology professionals, patients and their families, caregivers and kidney health advocacy organizations to draw, during the Decade of the Kidney (2020-30), the attention of authorities to realize changes in understanding, research and treatment of kidney disease.","['acute kidney injury', 'chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'environment', 'epidemiology', 'health economy', 'kidney transplantation', 'mortality', 'non-communicable diseases', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Clinical kidney journal,2021-07-06,"[{'lastname': 'Vanholder', 'firstname': 'Raymond', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Nephrology Section, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.\nEuropean Kidney Health Alliance, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Annemans', 'firstname': 'Lieven', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health and Primary Care, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.\nDepartment of Public Health, Interuniversity Center for Health Economics Research (I-CHER), Free University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Bello', 'firstname': 'Aminu K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bikbov', 'firstname': 'Boris', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Istituto di Richerche Farmcologiche Mario Negri RICCS, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gallego', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'European Kidney Patient Federation (EKPF), Dublin, Ireland.\nSpanish Kidney Patient Federation (ALCER), Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gansevoort', 'firstname': 'Ron T', 'initials': 'RT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Lameire', 'firstname': 'Norbert', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics,\u2002Nephrology Section, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Luyckx', 'firstname': 'Valerie A', 'initials': 'VA', 'affiliation': ""Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.\nRenal Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Noruisiene', 'firstname': 'Edita', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'European Dialysis and Transplant Nurses Association-European Renal Care Association (EDTNA/ERCA), Nidwalden, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Oostrom', 'firstname': 'Tom', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Dutch Kidney Foundation, Bussum, the Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Wanner', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Nephrology Section, Würzburg University, Würzburg University Hospital, Würzburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wieringa', 'firstname': 'Fokko', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'IMEC Eindhoven, Eindhoven, the Netherlands.\nDepartment of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}]",None,None,None,© The Author(s) 2021.

30448393",Management of Kidney Failure in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: What Are the Best Options?,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most frequent cause of kidney failure (KF). There are large variations in the incidence rates of kidney replacement therapy (KRT). Late referral to nephrology services has been associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes. In many countries, when patients reach severely reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), they are managed by multidisciplinary teams led by nephrologists. In these clinics, efforts will continue to halt chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and to prevent cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. In patients with diabetes and severely reduced GFR and KF, treating hyperglycemia is a challenge, since some drugs are contraindicated and most of them require dose adjustments. Even more, a decision-making process will help in deciding whether the patient would prefer comprehensive conservative care or KRT. On many occasions, this decision will be conditioned by diabetes mellitus itself. Effective education should cover the necessary information for the patient and family to answer these questions: 1. Should I go for KRT or not? 2. If the answer is KRT, dialysis and/or transplantation? 3. Dialysis at home or in center? 4. If dialysis at home, peritoneal dialysis or home hemodialysis? 5. If transplantation is desired, discuss the options of whether the donation would be from a living or deceased donor. This review addresses the determinant factors with an impact on DKD, aiming to shed light on the specific needs that arise in the management and recommendations on how to achieve a comprehensive approach to the diabetic patient with chronic kidney disease.","['chronic kidney disease', 'comprehensive conservative care', 'diabetic kidney disease', 'hemodialysis', 'home hemodialysis', 'kidney failure', 'kidney replacement therapy', 'kidney transplant', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Journal of clinical medicine,2021-07-03,"[{'lastname': 'Buades', 'firstname': 'Juan M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario Son Llàtzer, Balearic Islands, 07198 Palma de Mallorca, Spain.\nHealth Research Institute of the Balearic Islands (IdISBa), 07120 Palma de Mallorca, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Craver', 'firstname': 'Lourdes', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario Arnau de Vilanova, 25198 Lleida, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Del Pino', 'firstname': 'Maria Dolores', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Complejo Hospitalario Torrecárdenas de Almería, 04009 Almería, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Prieto-Velasco', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon, 24001 León, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruiz', 'firstname': 'Juan C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Valdecilla Hospital, University of Cantabria, 39008 Santander, Spain.\nValdecilla Biomedical Research Institute (IDIVAL), Cardenal Herrera Oria S/N, 39011 Santander, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Salgueira', 'firstname': 'Mercedes', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, 41009 Seville, Spain.\nBiomedical Engineering Group, Medicine Department, University of Seville, 41092 Seville, Spain.\nCenter for Biomedical Research Network in Bioengineering Biomaterials and Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN), 28029 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'de Sequera', 'firstname': 'Patricia', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, 28031 Madrid, Spain.\nMedicine Department, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28031 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Vega', 'firstname': 'Nicanor', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Universitario de Gran Canaria Dr. Negrín, 35010 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/jcm10132943

32577250",Repeat exit site infection in peritoneal dialysis patient with polycythemia vera - a case report.,"Infectious complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD) remain a common cause of catheter loss and discontinuation of PD. Exit site infection (ESI) constitutes a significant risk factor for PD-related peritonitis and determination of predisposing states is relevant. We here present a case of repeat ESI due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a PD patient with skin changes in the course of polycythemia vera (PV).
A 73-year-old PD patient with chronic kidney disease secondary to renal amyloidosis and ankylosing spondylitis, presented to the nephrology unit with signs of ESI. In 2006 he was diagnosed with PV and since then has was successfully treated with hydroxyurea; however, he reported recurrent episodes of developing skin nodules in the course of the disease. Exit site swab yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the infection developed in the ulcerated PV nodule that appeared in exit site 2 weeks earlier. Patient was treated with intraperitoneal amikacin and oral ciprofloxacin, however, due to neurological complications, the treatment had to be interrupted and finally catheter was removed. Similar episode of ESI with Pseudomonas aeruginosa developed in the patient two years earlier and also required catheter removal.
This is the first case report demonstrating the development of ESI on the polycythemia vera skin lesion in this area.

33269260",SARS-CoV2 Related Multi System Inflammatory Syndrome in a Child with Chronic Kidney Disease: Case Report.,"Since April 2020, several paediatric cases were reported with a multisystemic inflammatory syndrome related with SARS-CoV2, called MIS-C. In this case report, we describe a 2-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in renal replacement therapy (RRT) with peritoneal dialysis and severe hypertension affected by a severe SARS-CoV2 related illness characterised by multiorgan failure and need for intensive care, with clinical and instrumental features compatible with MIS-C. Most paediatric patients with kidney disease experience mild SARS-CoV2 disease and to our knowledge, this is the first case of a child with chronic kidney disease suffering from MIS-C. We believe that chronic kidney disease together with dialysis status and severe hypertension play a crucial role on developing severe forms of SARS-CoV2 related disease.","['COVID', 'Case report', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Coronavirus', 'MIS-C', 'Paediatric']",SN comprehensive clinical medicine,2021-07-01,"[{'lastname': 'Stefanachi', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Paediatric Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplant Unit, University Hospital of Padova, Padua, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Benetti', 'firstname': 'Elisa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Paediatric Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplant Unit, University Hospital of Padova, Padua, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Longo', 'firstname': 'Germana', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Paediatric Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplant Unit, University Hospital of Padova, Padua, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Parolin', 'firstname': 'Mattia', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Paediatric Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplant Unit, University Hospital of Padova, Padua, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Bonardi', 'firstname': 'Claudia Maria', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Padova, Padua, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Meneghesso', 'firstname': 'Davide', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Paediatric Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplant Unit, University Hospital of Padova, Padua, Italy.""}]",None,None,None,"© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","10.1007/s42399-021-01004-0

24335120",Tackling Dialysis Burden around the World: A Global Challenge.,"CKD is a global problem that causes significant burden to the healthcare system and the economy in addition to its impact on morbidity and mortality of patients. Around the world, in both developing and developed economies, the nephrologists and governments face the challenges of the need to provide a quality and cost-effective kidney replacement therapy for CKD patients when their kidneys fail. In December 2019, the 3rd International Congress of Chinese Nephrologists was held in Nanjing, China, and in the meeting, a symposium and roundtable discussion on how to deal with this CKD burden was held with opinion leaders from countries and regions around the world, including Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA. The participants concluded that an integrated approach with early detection of CKD, prompt treatment to slow down progression, promotion of home-based dialysis therapy like peritoneal dialysis and home HD, together with promotion of kidney transplantation, are possible effective ways to combat this ongoing worldwide challenge.","['Chronic kidney disease', 'End-stage kidney disease', 'Home dialysis', 'Kidney transplantation', 'Prevention']","Kidney diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-06-29,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Philip Kam-Tao', 'initials': 'PK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Carol and Richard Yu Peritoneal Dialysis Research Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Gordon Chun-Kau', 'initials': 'GC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Carol and Richard Yu Peritoneal Dialysis Research Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Jianghua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Disease Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Hung-Chun', 'initials': 'HC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Yuk-Lun', 'initials': 'YL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, Tai Po, Hong Kong, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fan', 'firstname': 'Stanley L-S', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine and Transplantation, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'John Cijiang', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hu', 'firstname': 'Weixin', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Diseases, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Wai-Hon', 'initials': 'WH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Washington, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Pei', 'firstname': 'York', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto and University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Teo', 'firstname': 'Boon Wee', 'initials': 'BW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Ping', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Disease Center, the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Xueqing', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital & Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Liu', 'firstname': 'Zhi-Hong', 'initials': 'ZH', 'affiliation': 'National Clinical Research Center of Kidney Diseases, Jinling Hospital, Nanjing University School of Medicine, Nanjing, China.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2021 by S.

This study investigated the efficacy and safety of roxadustat in Chinese patients with anemia on peritoneal dialysis (PD).
One hundred and twenty-nine patients were randomized and treated with roxadustat (n = 86) or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) (n = 43) for 24 weeks. The primary end points were the mean hemoglobin (Hb) level at week 24, the change in average Hb levels from baseline to week 24, and the cumulative response rate throughout the treatment period. The secondary end points included changes in hepcidin and iron indices and serum lipid levels. Subgroup analysis examined the effect of inflammatory status on the efficacy of Hb. Safety was assessed as the occurrence of emergent adverse events after treatment.
The mean average Hb levels at week 24 and average change in Hb levels from baseline to week 24 were 11.5 g/dL and 2.5 g/dL in the roxadustat group and 11.2 g/dL and 2.2 g/dL in the ESAs group, respectively. The cumulative response rate was 96% in the roxadustat group and 92% in the ESAs group at week 24. Roxadustat decreased hepcidin levels and increased total iron-binding capacity. The decreases in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were greater with roxadustat than with ESAs. Roxadustat-induced Hb increases were independent of baseline C-reactive protein levels. Common adverse events included hyperkalemia, hypertension, and insomnia.

22748072",The WISHED Randomized Controlled Trial: Impact of an Interactive Health Communication Application on Home Dialysis Use in People With Chronic Kidney Disease.,"While home dialysis therapies are more cost effective and may offer improved health-related quality of life, uptake compared to in-center hemodialysis remains low.
To test whether a web-based interactive health communication application (IHCA) compared to usual care would increase home dialysis use.
Randomized control trial.
Patients were recruited from 3 multidisciplinary kidney clinics across Ontario, Canada (Hamilton, Kingston, London).
We included adults with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) followed in multidisciplinary kidney clinics. Patients who had not completed dialysis modality education, who did not have access to a home computer or the internet, who had significant hearing or vision impairment, who could not read/write/speak English, who had a medical contraindication for home dialysis, or who had selected conservative kidney care were excluded.
The primary outcome was any use of home dialysis (peritoneal dialysis or home hemodialysis) within 90 days of dialysis initiation. Secondary outcomes were social support, decision conflict and dialysis knowledge measured at baseline, 6 months and 1 year.
Eligible patients were randomized to either usual care or the IHCA in addition to usual care in a 1:1 ratio. As part of usual care, all patients received education about dialysis modalities and kidney transplantation delivered by clinic nurses according to local practices. Randomization was performed using a computer-generated sequence in randomly permuted block sizes, stratified by site, and allocation occurred using sequentially numbered sealed, opaque envelopes. Participants, care providers, and outcome assessors were not blinded to the intervention. All analyses were performed blinded using an intention to treat approach. We estimated the effect of the ICHA on the odds of the primary outcome using unadjusted logistic regression models. Linear mixed models for repeated measures over time were used to analyze the impact of the IHCA on the secondary outcomes of interest.
We randomized 140 (usual care, n = 71; IHCA, n = 69) out of a planned 264 patients (mean [SD] age 61 [14.5] years, 65% men). Among patients randomized to the IHCA group that completed 6-month and 1-year follow-up visits, 56.8% and 71.4%, respectively, had not accessed the IHCA website within the past month. There were 23 (32.4%) and 26 (37.7%) patients in the usual care and IHCA groups who received a home dialysis therapy within 90 days of dialysis initiation (odds ratio, OR = 1.3, 95% CI = [0.6-2.5], 
The trial was underpowered due to poor recruitment and use of the IHCA was low.
We did not find evidence of a difference in home dialysis uptake with IHCA use, but our analyses were notably underpowered. The incorporation of greater patient engagement, qualitative research and design research, and pilot implementation may help future evaluations of strategies to improve home dialysis uptake.
La dialyse à domicile est une modalité plus économique qui améliore la qualité de vie liée à la santé des patients. Malgré cela, son adoption demeure faible par rapport à l’hémodialyse en centre hospitalier.
Vérifier si l’utilization d’une application interactive de communication en santé (AICS) accessible en ligne augmente l’adoption de la dialyse à domicile comparativement aux soins habituels.
Essai contrôlé à répartition aléatoire.
Les patients ont été recrutés dans trois cliniques multidisciplinaires de néphrologie en Ontario, au Canada (Hamilton, Kingston, London).
Nous avons inclus des adultes atteints d’insuffisance rénale chronique (IRC) de stade avancé suivis en clinique multidisciplinaire de néphrologie. Ont été exclus les patients n’ayant pas terminé la formation sur les modalités de dialyse, n’ayant pas accès à un ordinateur ou à Internet à domicile, ayant une déficience auditive ou visuelle importante, ne sachant pas lire, écrire ou parler en anglais, présentant une contre-indication médicale à la dialyse à domicile ou ayant choisi un traitement conservateur.
Le principal résultat était utilisation de la dialyse à domicile (dialyse péritonéale ou hémodialyse) dans les 90 jours suivant l’amorce du traitement. Les critères d’évaluation secondaires étaient le soutien social, les conflits décisionnels et les connaissances en matière de dialyse mesurés à l’inclusion, après six mois et après un an.
Les patients admissibles ont été répartis aléatoirement dans un rapport 1:1 pour recevoir les soins habituels ou l’AICS en plus des soins habituels. Dans le cadre des soins habituels, tous les patients ont reçu une formation sur les modalités de dialyse et la transplantation rénale donnée par le personnel infirmier de la clinique, conformément aux pratiques locales. La répartition aléatoire a été effectuée à l’aide d’une séquence générée par ordinateur dans des blocs de taille permutée au hasard, stratifiés par site. L’attribution s’est faite par enveloppes scellées et opaques, numérotées de façon séquentielle. L’intervention ne s’est pas faite à l’insu des participants, des fournisseurs de soins et des évaluateurs. Toutes les analyses ont été effectuées en aveugle avec une approche en intention de traiter. Nous avons estimé l’effet de l’AICS sur les probabilités du résultat principal en utilisant des modèles de régression logistique non corrigés. Des modèles mixtes linéaires pour des mesures répétées dans le temps ont été employés pour analyser l’impact de l’AICS sur les critères secondaires d’intérêt.
Des 264 patients prévus au départ (âge moyen [ÉT]: 61 [14,5] ans; 65 % d’hommes), 140 ont été répartis aléatoirement (71 en soins habituels; 69 avec l’AICS). Dans le groupe AICS, 56,8 % des patients ayant eu une visite de suivi après six mois et 71,4 % après un an n’avaient pas accédé au site Web de l’AICS au cours du mois précédent. Le nombre de patients ayant adopté la dialyse à domicile dans les 90 jours s’élevait à 23 (32,4 %) dans le groupe des soins habituels et à 26 (37,7 %) dans le groupe AICS (risque relatif [RR]: 1,3; IC 95 %: 0,6-2,5; p=0,5). Des 78 patients ayant amorcé des traitements de dialyse (38 en soins habituels; 40 avec l’AICS), la proportion de patients ayant reçu la dialyse à domicile dans les 90 suivants s’élevait à 60,5 % dans le groupe des soins habituels et à 65 % dans le groupe AICS (RR: 1,2; IC 95 %: 0,5-3,0; p=0,7). Les critères d’évaluation secondaires n’ont pas différé au fil du temps selon le groupe d’intervention.
L’essai manque de robustesse en raison du faible recrutement et de la faible utilisation de l’AICS.
Nous n’avons trouvé aucune preuve supportant une plus grande adoption de la dialyse à domicile avec l’AICS, mais nos analyses manquaient nettement de robustesse.

Oman's publication on this aspect is limited and therefore, this study was conducted. This study analyzed the data obtained from the RRT register in Oman. The main measurements and aim are to identify the incidence and prevalence of Oman's treated RRT population (1983-2018) with a major focus on the hemodialysis (HD) cohort. The year 1983 is the year when renal care was started in Oman. The total number of patients registered on Oman's RRT register of the central renal dialysis center from 1983 to 2010 was 3524, distributed among the following treatment cohorts; HD, 2328 patients (66%); kidney transplant, 1,144 patients (32.5%); peritoneal dialysis, 52 patients (1.5%). However, the treated patients alive on HD by end of 2018 were 2023. The dialysis sub-population increased from 35 patients in 1983 to 2023 patients in 2018. The recorded incidence registered in 1983 was 34 patients, in 1986 was 33, in 2013 was 168, in 2015 was 230, and in 2018 was 350 RRT treated patients per million population of Oman. There is a progressive rise of the incidence and prevalence of Oman's RRT population. This rise is similar to many nations, especially developing countries that are being faced with the rising trend of noncommunicable diseases (NCD). The health system and other stakeholders ought to take various stringent policies to ameliorate the progressive increase of NCD and hence, reduce the burden of chronic kidney disease and ESKD.",[],"Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2021-06-20,"[{'lastname': ""Al-Za'abi"", 'firstname': 'Ruqiya K', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Oman College of Health Sciences, North Batinah Governorate, Oman; School of Nursing and Health Care, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Tolmie', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth P', 'initials': 'EP', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing and Health Care, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Rice', 'firstname': 'Ann Marie', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'School of Nursing and Health Care, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Mohsin', 'firstname': 'Nabil', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Nephrology, Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Busadi', 'firstname': 'Ahmed Said', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Primary Care, Ministry of Health, Muscat, Oman.'}]",None,None,None,None,10.4103/1319-2442.318521,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x2882349a0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,34145129,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145129,2.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

31087375",Association between physical activity and mortality in end-stage kidney disease: a systematic review of observational studies.,"End-stage Kidney Disease patients have a high mortality and hospitalization risk. The association of these outcomes with physical activity is described in the general population and in other chronic diseases. However, few studies examining this association have been completed in end-stage Kidney Disease patients, raising the need to systematically review the evidence on the association of physical activity with mortality and hospitalization in this population.
Electronic databases (EBSCO, Scopus and Web of Science) and hand search were performed until March 2020 for observational studies reporting the association of physical activity with mortality or hospitalization in adult end-stage Kidney Disease patients on renal replacement therapy (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplant). Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020155591).
Eleven studies were included: six in hemodialysis, three in kidney transplant, and two in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. Physical activity was self-reported, except in one study that used accelerometers. All-cause mortality was addressed in all studies and cardiovascular mortality in three studies. Nine studies reported a significant reduction in all-cause mortality with increased levels of physical activity. Evidence of a dose-response relationship was found. For cardiovascular mortality, a significant reduction was observed in two of the three studies. Only one study investigated the association of physical activity with hospitalization.
Higher physical activity was associated with reduced mortality in end-stage Kidney Disease patients. Future studies using objective physical activity measures could strengthen these findings. The association of physical activity with hospitalization should be explored in future investigations.","['Chronic Kidney Disease', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Physical Activity', 'Survival']",BMC nephrology,2021-06-20,"[{'lastname': 'Martins', 'firstname': 'Pedro', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Research Center in Sports Sciences, Health Sciences and Human Development, CIDESD, University Institute of Maia, ISMAI, Maia, Portugal.\nFresenius Medical Care, NephroCare, Lisbon, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Marques', 'firstname': 'Elisa A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Research Center in Sports Sciences, Health Sciences and Human Development, CIDESD, University Institute of Maia, ISMAI, Maia, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Leal', 'firstname': 'Diogo V', 'initials': 'DV', 'affiliation': 'Research Center in Sports Sciences, Health Sciences and Human Development, CIDESD, University Institute of Maia, ISMAI, Maia, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferreira', 'firstname': 'Aníbal', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Fresenius Medical Care, NephroCare, Lisbon, Portugal.\nCurry Cabral Hospital, University Hospital Centre of Central Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.\nNova Medical School, Lisbon, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilund', 'firstname': 'Kenneth R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiology and Community Health, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Viana', 'firstname': 'João L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Research Center in Sports Sciences, Health Sciences and Human Development, CIDESD, University Institute of Maia, ISMAI, Maia, Portugal. jviana@ismai.pt.'}]",None,None,"Eleven studies were included: six in hemodialysis, three in kidney transplant, and two in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.

29162680",Peritoneal Dialysis Use in Patients With Ascites: A Review.,"The past few decades have seen steady increase in the prevalence of kidney failure needing kidney replacement therapy. Concomitantly, there has been progressive growth of heart failure and chronic liver disease, and many such patients develop ascites. Therefore, it is not uncommon to encounter patients with kidney failure who concurrently have ascites. The presence of ascites adds many challenges in the management of kidney failure. Poor hemodynamics make volume management difficult. The presence of coagulopathy, malnutrition, and encephalopathy compounds the complexity of the management. Such patients do not tolerate hemodialysis well. However, several concerns have limited the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD), so hemodialysis remains the predominant dialysis modality in these patients. However, observational studies have illustrated that PD provides hemodynamic stability and facilitates better volume management compared with hemodialysis. Moreover, PD obviates the need for therapeutic paracentesis by facilitating continuous drainage of ascites. PD potentially reduces hemorrhagic complications by avoiding routine anticoagulation use. Moreover, small studies have suggested that outcomes such as peritonitis and mechanical complications are comparable to those in PD patients without ascites. PD does not affect transplant candidacy, and these patients can successfully receive combined liver and kidney transplants. Hence, PD should be considered a viable dialysis option in kidney failure patients with ascites.","['Ascites', 'catheter placement', 'chronic kidney disease (CKD)', 'chronic liver disease (CLD)', 'cirrhosis', 'dialysis', 'dialysis modality', 'fill volume', 'hypoalbuminemia', 'kidney failure', 'nutritional status', 'peritoneal dialysis (PD)', 'peritonitis', 'review', 'simultaneous kidney and liver transplant (SLKT)', 'volume status']",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2021-06-19,"[{'lastname': 'Rajora', 'firstname': 'Nilum', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.'}, {'lastname': 'De Gregorio', 'firstname': 'Lucia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Transplant Surgery, Department of Surgery, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.'}, {'lastname': 'Saxena', 'firstname': 'Ramesh', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.

33706584",Anemia Management in Peritoneal Dialysis: Perspectives From the Asia Pacific Region.,"Anemia is an important complication in patients with chronic kidney disease. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of the most common modalities of kidney replacement therapy for patients with end-stage kidney disease. PD is particularly prevalent in the Asian Pacific region. Among the different countries and regions, including mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand, PD accounts for 2.8% to 74.6% of the dialysis population. In addition, 82% to 96% of the PD populations from these countries and regions are receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Asian Pacific countries and regions follow the latest KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines for the initiation of treatment of anemia in PD patients. The types of ESAs commonly used include shorter-acting (epoetin alfa and beta) and longer-acting agents, including darbepoetin alfa or methoxy polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta. The most commonly used ESAs in Mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand are the shorter-acting agents, whereas in Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea, longer-acting ESAs are most common. Oral iron therapy is still the most commonly used iron supplement. The route and dosage of iron administration in PD patients requires more research studies. With the introduction of oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors into clinical use, the landscape of treatment of anemia in the PD population in the Asia Pacific region may change in the coming years.","['Anemia', 'Asia Pacific', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Kidney medicine,2021-06-18,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Philip Kam Tao', 'initials': 'PKT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Carol and Richard Yu Peritoneal Dialysis Research Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, SAR, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Choy', 'firstname': 'Agnes Shin Man', 'initials': 'ASM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Carol and Richard Yu Peritoneal Dialysis Research Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, SAR, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Bavanandan', 'firstname': 'Sunita', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Key Laboratory of Nephrology, National Health Commission of China and Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Foo', 'firstname': 'Marjorie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Kanjanabuch', 'firstname': 'Talerngsak', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Center of Excellence in Kidney Metabolic Disorders and Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Yong-Lim', 'initials': 'YL', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakayama', 'firstname': 'Masaaki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Kidney Center, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.""}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Xueqing', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': ""Department of Nephrology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangzhou, China.\nGuangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, China.""}]",None,None,None,© 2021 The Authors.,"10.1016/j.xkme.2021.01.011

31707860",Coronary Artery Calcification as a Marker for Coronary Artery Stenosis: Comparing Kidney Failure to the General Population.,"The presence of calcified plaques in the coronary arteries is associated with cardiovascular mortality and is a hallmark of chronic kidney failure, but it is unclear whether this is associated with the same degree of coronary artery stenosis as in patients without kidney disease. We compared the relationship of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and stenosis between dialysis patients and patients without chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Observational cohort study.
127 dialysis patients and 447 patients without CKD with cardiovascular risk factors underwent cardiac computed tomography (CT), consisting of non-contrast-enhanced CT and CT angiography. CAC score and degree of coronary artery stenosis were assessed by independent readers.
Dialysis treatment.
Association between calcification and stenosis.
Logistic regression to determine the association between CAC score and the presence of stenosis in a matched cohort and, in the full cohort, testing for the interaction of dialysis status with this relationship.
112 patients were matched from each cohort, totaling 224 patients, using propensity scores for dialysis, balancing numerous cardiovascular risk factors. Median CAC score was 210 (IQR, 19-859) in dialysis patients and 58 (IQR, 0-254) in patients without CKD; 35% of dialysis patients and 36% of patients without CKD had coronary artery stenosis ≥ 50%. Per each 100-unit higher CAC score, the matched dialysis cohort had significantly lower ORs for stenosis than the non-CKD cohort, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.52-0.83) for stenosis ≥ 50% and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.62-0.90) for stenosis ≥ 70%.
No comparison with the gold standard fractional flow reserve.
Dialysis patients have higher risk for coronary artery stenosis with higher CAC scores, but this risk is comparatively lower than in patients without CKD with similar CAC scores. In dialysis patients, a high CAC score can easily be found without significant stenosis. Our data enable ""translation"" of degree of calcification to the probability of coronary stenosis in dialysis patients.","['Coronary calcification', 'coronary stenosis', 'end-stage kidney disease', 'hemodialysis', 'ischemic cardiac disease', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'renal failure']",Kidney medicine,2021-06-18,"[{'lastname': 'Jansz', 'firstname': 'Thijs T', 'initials': 'TT', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.'}, {'lastname': 'Go', 'firstname': 'Meike H Y', 'initials': 'MHY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.\nOn behalf of the UCC-SMART study group, Department of Vascular Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.'}, {'lastname': 'Hartkamp', 'firstname': 'Nolan S', 'initials': 'NS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.\nDepartment of Radiology, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam.'}, {'lastname': 'Stöger', 'firstname': 'J Lauran', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.\nDepartment of Radiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden.'}, {'lastname': 'Celeng', 'firstname': 'Csilla', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.'}, {'lastname': 'Leiner', 'firstname': 'Tim', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.'}, {'lastname': 'de Jong', 'firstname': 'Pim A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.'}, {'lastname': 'Visseren', 'firstname': 'Frank J L', 'initials': 'FJL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.\nOn behalf of the UCC-SMART study group, Department of Vascular Medicine, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.'}, {'lastname': 'Verhaar', 'firstname': 'Marianne C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht.'}, {'lastname': 'van Jaarsveld', 'firstname': 'Brigit C', 'initials': 'BC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Amsterdam.\nDianet Dialysis Centers, Utrecht, the Netherlands.'}]",None,None,"112 patients were matched from each cohort, totaling 224 patients, using propensity scores for dialysis, balancing numerous cardiovascular risk factors.

353,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34128096,Omentectomy reduces the need for peritoneal dialysis catheter revision in children: a study from the Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium.,"There are no multi-center studies examining omentectomy and peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter revision in the pediatric dialysis population.
We performed a retrospective study at eight centers within the Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium (PNRC). Data review included all incident tunneled PD catheters placed between 1/1/2011 and 12/31/2016 in pediatric stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD 5) patients. The primary outcome was the need for catheter revision and/or replacement. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to evaluate predictors for catheter revision/replacement.
Data from 184 children (62.5% male; median age 7.4 years) were analyzed. Omentectomy was completed in 63.6% (n = 117). Revision/replacement occurred in 34.2% (n = 63); median time to revision/replacement was 38.5 days after insertion. PD catheter revision/replacement catheter occurred in 23.9% who underwent omentectomy versus 52.2% without omentectomy (p = 0.0005). Children ≥ 6 years at the time of catheter insertion experienced fewer revisions/replacements (18.2% age ≥ 6 vs. 56.5% age < 6 years, p <0.001). After adjusting for covariates, omentectomy reduced the need for revision by 63%; revision was 3.66 times more likely in those < 6 years of age.
This multi-center study demonstrates that omentectomy at the time of PD catheter insertion in pediatric patients is strongly associated with reduced likelihood of PD catheter revision. Omentectomy should be considered at the time of PD catheter insertion, especially in young children who are at high risk for PD catheter malfunction.

354,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34118302,Barriers to and Facilitators of Sustained Employment: A Qualitative Study of Experiences in Dutch Patients With CKD.,"Although patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk for work disability and loss of employment, not all experience work disruption. We aimed to describe the barriers to and facilitators of sustained employment experienced by Dutch patients with CKD.
Qualitative study using semistructured interviews.
27 patients with CKD glomerular filtration rate categories 3b-5 (G3b-G5) from 4 nephrology outpatient clinics in The Netherlands.
Content analyses with constant comparison of interview data based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework.
Participants were 6 patients with CKD G3b-G4, 8 patients receiving maintenance dialysis, and 13 patients with functioning kidney transplants. We identified health-related barriers (symptoms, physical toll of dialysis/transplantation, limited work capacity) and facilitators (few physical symptoms, successful posttransplantation recovery, absence of comorbidities, good physical condition), personal barriers (psychological impact, limited work experience) and facilitators (positive disposition, job satisfaction, work attitude, person-job fit), and environmental barriers and facilitators. Environmental barriers were related to nephrology care (waiting time, use of a hemodialysis catheter) and work context (reorganization, temporary contract, working hours, physical demands); environmental facilitators were related to nephrology care (personalized dialysis, preemptive transplant), work context (large employer, social climate, job requiring mental rather than physical labor, flexible working hours, adjustment of work tasks, reduced hours, remote working, support at work, peritoneal dialysis exchange facility), and support at home. Occupational health services and social security could be barriers or facilitators.
The study sample of Dutch patients may limit the transferability of these findings to other countries.
The wide range of barriers and facilitators in all International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health components suggests great diversity among patients and their circumstances. These findings underline the importance of personalized nephrology and occupational health care as well as the importance of individually tailored workplace accommodations to promote sustained employment for patients with CKD.","['Chronic kidney disease (CKD)', 'barriers and facilitators', 'chronic illness', 'dialysis', 'disability', 'employee perspectives', 'employment maintenance', 'occupational health care', 'qualitative research', 'sick leave', 'sustained employment', 'transplant recipient', 'work participation', 'workplace accommodations']",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2021-06-13,"[{'lastname': 'van der Mei', 'firstname': 'Sijrike F', 'initials': 'SF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Applied Health Research, Groningen.

This study examined the safety and efficacy of the automated wearable artificial kidney (AWAK) device in PD patients.
This pilot study included prevalent PD patients from a single center in Singapore between 2016 and 2018. Participants underwent up to nine AWAK therapies over 72 h and were followed up for 1 month. Primary outcomes were serious adverse events (SAEs) and completion of nine therapies without device deficiency. Secondary outcomes were weekly peritoneal Kt/
Twenty-one patients were screened and 15 were included in the study. Device alterations were required to overcome issues including flow occlusions initially, which resulted in three cohorts (
This preliminary study demonstrated that no SAEs were observed with the AWAK-PD device; however, 60% of participants developed abdominal pain/discomfort. Further device enhancements are needed to improve ultrafiltration and reduce AEs.","['Artificial kidney', 'chronic kidney disease', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'wearables']",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,2021-06-10,"[{'lastname': 'Htay', 'firstname': 'Htay', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.\nDUKE-NUS Medical School, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Gow', 'firstname': 'Sheena K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'AWAK Technologies Pte Ltd, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Jayaballa', 'firstname': 'Mathini', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.\nDUKE-NUS Medical School, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Oei', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth L', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.\nDUKE-NUS Medical School, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Choong-Meng', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.\nDUKE-NUS Medical School, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Sin-Yan', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.'}, {'lastname': 'Foo', 'firstname': 'Marjorie Wy', 'initials': 'MW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.\nDUKE-NUS Medical School, Singapore.'}]",None,None,"Twenty-one patients were screened and 15 were included in the study.

9987089",Possible benefits of exogenous melatonin for individuals on dialysis: a narrative review on potential mechanisms and clinical implications.,"Prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation in chronic kidney disease patients (CKD) on dialysis may reduce dialysis-associated complications. Administration of powerful antioxidants may improve the consequences of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD). This narrative review aimed to show the potential therapeutic effects of melatonin (MLT) on the consequences of CKD patients receiving HD or PD. The results of preclinical and clinical studies have proven that CKD and dialysis are accompanied by reduced endogenous MLT levels and related complications such as sleep disorders. Enhanced oxidative stress, inflammation, cellular damages, and renal fibrosis, along with dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), have been observed in CKD and patients on dialysis. Results of studies have revealed that the restoration of MLT via the exogenous source may regulate oxidative stress, inflammation, and RAS functions, inhibit fibrosis, and improve complications in patients with long-term dialysis patients. In summary, treatment of patients with CKD and dialysis with exogenous MLT is suggested as a practical approach in reducing the outcomes and improving the quality of life in patients via antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic signaling pathways. Therefore, this hormone can be considered in clinical practice to manage dialysis-related complications.","['Dialysis', 'Inflammation', 'Melatonin', 'Oxidative stress', 'Renal fibrosis', 'Renin-angiotensin system', 'Sleep disorders']",Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,2021-06-08,"[{'lastname': 'Movahhed', 'firstname': 'Seyed Majid Mousavi', 'initials': 'SMM', 'affiliation': 'Baharloo Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

360,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34089536,Endocrine contribution to the sexual dysfunction in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and the role of hyperprolactinemia.,"In this study, we investigated the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among males with advanced chronic kidney disease and the effect of treating hyperprolactinemia among these patients. In this prospective study, patients were assessed with history, physical examination, hormonal assessment, and two questionnaires, IIEF and AIPE. Patients with hyperprolactinemia received treatment with cabergoline 0.5 mg once per week for 6 months and were re-evaluated. A total of 102 patients were included in this study, 75 (73.53%) were on hemodialysis, 13 (12.75%) on peritoneal dialysis and 14 (13.73%) on medical treatment alone. Ninety (88.24%) patients had premature ejaculation, 85 (83.33%) had anything from mild-to-moderate-to-severe erectile dysfunction. The incidence of hypogonadism and hyperprolactinemia was 34.4%. Patients treated with cabergoline (n = 26) showed a significant increase in LH levels (p = .003) and a significant decrease in prolactin levels (p = .003). Testosterone levels and the incidence of erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation did not improve significantly. There is a high incidence of sexual dysfunction among patients. Treatment of hyperprolactinemia is effective in correcting prolactin levels, but does not improve erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation. Therefore, treating hyperprolactinemia is not an overall effective treatment for erectile dysfunction in these patients.","['end-stage renal disease', 'erectile dysfunction', 'hyperprolactinemia', 'hypogonadism', 'premature ejaculation']",Andrologia,2021-06-06,"[{'lastname': 'Elbardisi', 'firstname': 'Haitham', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar.\nDepartment of Urology, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar.'}, {'lastname': 'Majzoub', 'firstname': 'Ahmad', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar.\nDepartment of Urology, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar.'}, {'lastname': 'Daniel', 'firstname': 'Christiana', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Political Science and Biological Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Al Ali', 'firstname': 'Fadwa', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar.'}, {'lastname': 'Elesnawi', 'firstname': 'Mohamed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar.'}, {'lastname': 'Khalafalla', 'firstname': 'Kareim', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar.'}, {'lastname': 'Agarwal', 'firstname': 'Ashok', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'American Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Henkel', 'firstname': 'Ralf', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'American Center for Reproductive Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.\nDepartment of Medical Biosciences, University of the Western Cape, Bellville, South Africa.\nDepartment of Metabolism, Digestion and Reproduction, Imperial College London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Alattar', 'firstname': 'Alia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Women Wellness and Research Center, Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Emadi', 'firstname': 'Ibrahim', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar.'}, {'lastname': 'Arafa', 'firstname': 'Mohamed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Urology, Hamad General Hospital, Doha, Qatar.\nDepartment of Urology, Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, Doha, Qatar.\nDepartment of Andrology, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.'}]",None,None,None,© 2021 The Authors.

361,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34089212,Misclassification of calcium status in end-stage kidney disease using albumin-adjusted calcium levels.,"Albumin-adjusted calcium remains widely used in clinical practice with guidelines for chronic kidney disease (CKD) mineral bone disorder recommending the use of serum calcium for monitoring. This is despite ionized calcium being the biologically active fraction. This study aimed to investigate the ability of total calcium and albumin-adjusted calcium to correctly assign calcium status in stage 5/5D CKD across non-dialysis, haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.
Over a 6-months, 352 paired serum and ionized calcium samples were collected from stage 5 (n = 58) and 5D (n = 294, 196 haemodialysis, 98 peritoneal dialysis) CKD patients in a tertiary-hospital setting. Albumin-adjusted calcium was calculated using the modified-Payne formula. Ionized calcium was the reference standard. The agreement between the two methods in assigning calcium status was assessed using Cohen's weighted kappa (κ) statistic.
Albumin-adjusted calcium was a poor predictor of calcium status compared to ionized calcium in stage 5/5D CKD (observed agreement 0.42, weighted κ 0.20, 95% CI 0.15-0.26). Dialysis dependence was associated with worse agreement (observed agreement 0.38, weighted κ 0.14, 95% CI 0.09-0.19). Total calcium was more reliable, however, remained inaccurate. Calcium status was not more accurately classified in those with higher albumin levels ≥30 g/L (observed agreement 0.47, weighted κ 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.36).
Total calcium provides better approximation of calcium status than albumin-adjusted calcium in stage 5/5D CKD. Albumin-adjusted calcium tends to 'overcorrect' serum calcium upward. Clinicians should use ionized calcium where accurate measure of calcium is indicated, with total calcium used as the next best option where resources are limited.","['albumin', 'calcium', 'chronic kidney disease', 'haemodialysis', 'mineral bone disease', 'peritoneal dialysis']","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2021-06-06,"[{'lastname': 'Law', 'firstname': 'Mandy M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nDepartment of Nephrology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Joel D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pathology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.\nLaboratory Services, The Royal Children's Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Schneider', 'firstname': 'Hans G', 'initials': 'HG', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Biochemistry Unit, The Alfred Pathology Service, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nMonash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilson', 'firstname': 'Scott', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nMonash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}]",None,"Total calcium provides better approximation of calcium status than albumin-adjusted calcium in stage 5/5D CKD.

28901990",Effects of fasting on patients with chronic kidney disease during Ramadan and practical guidance for healthcare professionals.,"There are an estimated 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide, with the majority of them choosing to fast during the month of Ramadan. Fasting, which requires abstinence from food and drink from dawn to sunset can be up to 20 h per day during the summer months in temperate regions. Fasting can be especially challenging in patients on haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Moreover, there is concern that those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can experience electrolyte imbalance and worsening of renal function. In this article, current literature is reviewed and a decision-making management tool has been developed to assist clinicians in discussing the risks of fasting in patients with CKD, with consideration also given to circumstances such as the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Our review highlights that patients with CKD wishing to fast should undergo a thorough risk assessment ideally within a month before Ramadan, as they may require medication changes and a plan for regular monitoring of renal function and electrolytes in order to fast safely. Recommendations have been based on risk tiers (very high risk, high risk and low-moderate risk) established by the International Diabetes Federation and the Diabetes and Ramadan International Alliance. Patients in the very high risk and high risk categories should be encouraged to explore alternative options to fasting, while those in the low-moderate category may be able to fast safely with guidance from their clinician. Prior to the commencement of Ramadan, all patients must receive up-to-date education on sick-day rules and instructions on when to terminate their fast or abstain from fasting.","['COVID-19', 'Ramadan', 'chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'fasting', 'pandemic']",Clinical kidney journal,2021-06-04,"[{'lastname': 'Malik', 'firstname': 'Shafi', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry, UK.\nUniversity of Leicester, Leicester, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bhanji', 'firstname': 'Amir', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Wessex Kidney Centre, Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust, Portsmouth, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Abuleiss', 'firstname': 'Husham', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hamer', 'firstname': 'Rizwan', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, Coventry, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Shah', 'firstname': 'Shahzad H', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'University Hospital Monklands, Airdrie, Scotland.'}, {'lastname': 'Rashad', 'firstname': 'Rafaqat', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Al Balagh Academy, Bradford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Junglee', 'firstname': 'Naushad', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'University Hospital Llandough, Cardiff and Vale, University Health Board, Cardiff, Wales.'}, {'lastname': 'Waqar', 'firstname': 'Salman', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghouri', 'firstname': 'Nazim', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, Glasgow, Scotland.\nDepartment of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Queen, Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, Scotland.'}]",None,None,None,© The Author(s) 2021.

31496117",Sufficiency of Knowledge Processed in Patient Education in Dialysis Care.,"Patient education improves health and treatment adherence of patients with chronic kidney disease. However, evidence about the sufficiency of patients' knowledge processed in patient education is limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate subjective and objective sufficiency of knowledge processed in patient education in dialysis care and treatment.
A cross-sectional study design was used. The sample (n=162) comprised patients in predialysis or home dialysis. All eligible patients during the data collection timeframe (2016-2017) in two university hospital districts in Finland were invited to participate. Subjective sufficiency was evaluated with a structured questionnaire having 34 items divided into six dimensions of empowering knowledge (bio-physiological, functional, social, experiential, ethical, and financial) on a Likert scale (1=not sufficient at all, 4=very sufficient). Objective sufficiency was evaluated with a structured knowledge test with 10 items (score range 0-10, correct=1, wrong/no knowledge=0) based on the multidimensional content of patient education emphasizing bio-physiological dimension.
In subjective sufficiency of knowledge, the mean was 3.27 (SD 0.54). The bio-physiological dimension of empowering knowledge was the most sufficient (mean 3.52, SD 0.49) and the experiential the least (mean 2.8, SD 0.88). In objective sufficiency, the means ranged 5.15-5.97 (SD 2.37-2.68) among patients in different modalities of dialysis care and treatment. The least sufficient objective scores were bio-physiological and functional knowledge. The subjective and objective sufficiency did not correlate with each other.
Patients' knowledge, either subjective or objective, does not seem to be sufficient. Hence, attention should be paid to supporting patients with more personalized knowledge. Furthermore, the relationship between subjective and objective sufficiency needs future consideration, as their non-correspondence was a new discovery.","['chronic kidney disease', 'hemodialysis', 'home', 'patient education as topic', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'renal dialysis']",Patient preference and adherence,2021-06-04,"[{'lastname': 'Inkeroinen', 'firstname': 'Saija', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing Science, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Koskinen', 'firstname': 'Jenni', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing Science, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.\nHematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Karlsson', 'firstname': 'Mia', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Center, Department of Medicine, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kilpi', 'firstname': 'Taina', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Turku City Welfare, City of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Leino-Kilpi', 'firstname': 'Helena', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing Science, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.\nTurku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Puukka', 'firstname': 'Pauli', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing Science, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Taponen', 'firstname': 'Ros-Marie', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Abdominal Center Dialysis Unit, Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Tuominen', 'firstname': 'Riitta', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Virtanen', 'firstname': 'Heli', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing Science, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.'}]",None,"Patients' knowledge, either subjective or objective, does not seem to be sufficient.

31597621","Age, diabetes mellitus, and dialysis modality are associated with risk of poor muscle strength and physical function in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.","Due to the poor outcomes associated with the impairment of physical function and muscle strength in patients on maintenance dialysis, it is important to understand the factors that may influence physical function and muscle strength. The aim of this study was to explore the factors associated with physical function in hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.
Patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis for at least 3 months, aged 18 years old or above, were enrolled. Physical function was assessed by handgrip strength, gait and sit-to-stand tests, and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Clinical and laboratory data were collected to verify the association with physical function parameters through binary logistic regression.
One-hundred ninety patients on maintenance dialysis were included; 140 patients (73.7%) on hemodialysis and 50 (26.3%) on peritoneal dialysis. The mean age was 57.3 ± 14.9 years, 109 (57.4%) were male, and 87 (45.8%) were older than 60 years. The median SPPB was 8.0 points (6.0-10.0 points) and the mean ± standard deviation of handgrip strength was 24.7 ± 12.2 kg. Binary logistic regression showed that age, type of renal replacement therapy, diabetes mellitus, and serum creatinine were significantly associated with both higher 4-meter gait test times and lower SPPB scores. Only age and diabetes mellitus were associated with higher sit-to-stand test times, while age and ferritin were associated with lower handgrip strength.

32034297",Why and how should we promote home dialysis for patients with end-stage kidney disease during and after the coronavirus 2019 disease pandemic? A French perspective.,"The health crisis induced by the pandemic of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) has had a major impact on dialysis patients in France. The incidence of infection with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic was 3.3% among dialysis patients-13 times higher than in the general population. The corresponding mortality rate was high, reaching 21%. As of 19th April, 2021, the cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in French dialysis patients was 14%. Convergent scientific data from France, Italy, the United Kingdom and Canada show that home dialysis reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by a factor of at least two. Unfortunately, home dialysis in France is not sufficiently developed: the proportion of dialysis patients being treated at home is only 7%. The obstacles to the provision of home care for patients with end-stage kidney disease in France include (i) an unfavourable pricing policy for home haemodialysis and nurse visits for assisted peritoneal dialysis (PD), (ii) insufficient training in home dialysis for nephrologists, (iii) the small number of administrative authorizations for home dialysis programs, and (iv) a lack of structured, objective information on renal replacement therapies for patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). We propose a number of pragmatic initiatives that could be simultaneously enacted to improve the situation in three areas: (i) the provision of objective information on renal replacement therapies for patients with advanced CKD, (ii) wider authorization of home dialysis networks and (iii) price increases in favour of home dialysis procedures.","['COVID-19', 'Home Dialysis', 'Home Haemodialysis', 'Peritoneal Dialysis', 'SARS-CoV-2']",Journal of nephrology,2021-06-02,"[{'lastname': 'Rostoker', 'firstname': 'Guy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Dialysis, Hôpital Privé Claude Galien, Ramsay Santé, Quincy-sous-Sénart, France. rostotom@orange.fr.\nCollège de Médecine des Hôpitaux de Paris, Paris, France. rostotom@orange.fr.'}, {'lastname': 'Issad', 'firstname': 'Belkacem', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Peritoneal Dialysis Centre, Nephrology Department, Groupe Hospitalier Pitié-Salpêtrière, AP-HP, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Fessi', 'firstname': 'Hafedh', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Home Haemodialysis Unit, Nephrology and Dialysis Department, Hôpital Tenon AP-HP, Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Massy', 'firstname': 'Ziad A', 'initials': 'ZA', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Department, Hôpital Ambroise Paré, APHP, Boulogne; and INSERM Unit 1018, CESP, University Versailles-St Quentin, University Paris Saclay, Villejuif, France.'}]",None,None,None,© 2021.

367,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34057463,High immunogenicity of a messenger RNA-based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in chronic dialysis patients.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease, dialysis patients and kidney transplant patients are at high risk of developing severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data regarding the immunogenicity of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 messenger RNA (anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA) vaccines in dialysis patients were published recently. We assessed the immunogenicity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in dialysis patients.
One hundred and nine patients on haemodialysis (n = 85) or peritoneal dialysis (n = 24) have received two injections of 30-μg doses of BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) that were administered intramuscularly 28 days apart. Those who were still seronegative after the second dose were given a third dose 1 month later. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were tested before and after vaccination.
Ninety-one out of the 102 patients who had at least a 1-month follow-up after the second (n = 97) or the third (n = 5) vaccine doses had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroconversion rate was 88.7% (86 out of 97 patients) among SARS-CoV-2 seronegative patients at the initiation of vaccination. Receiving immunosuppressive therapy was an independent predictive factor for non-response to vaccination.
Due to high immunogenicity and safety of mRNA vaccines, we strongly recommend prioritizing a two-dose vaccination of dialysis patients. A third dose can be required in non-responders to two doses. When possible, patients waiting for a kidney transplantation should be offered the vaccine before transplantation.","['COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV-2', 'haemodialysis', 'immunosuppression', 'peritoneal dialysis']","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2021-06-01,"[{'lastname': 'Longlune', 'firstname': 'Nathalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Organ Transplantation, Toulouse Rangueil University Hospital, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Nogier', 'firstname': 'Marie Béatrice', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Organ Transplantation, Toulouse Rangueil University Hospital, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Miedougé', 'firstname': 'Marcel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Virology, Toulouse Purpan University Hospital, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Gabilan', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Organ Transplantation, Toulouse Rangueil University Hospital, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Cartou', 'firstname': 'Charles', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Organ Transplantation, Toulouse Rangueil University Hospital, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Seigneuric', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Organ Transplantation, Toulouse Rangueil University Hospital, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Del Bello', 'firstname': 'Arnaud', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Organ Transplantation, Toulouse Rangueil University Hospital, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Marion', 'firstname': 'Olivier', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Organ Transplantation, Toulouse Rangueil University Hospital, Toulouse, France.\nPaul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France.\nINSERM UMR1043, Center for Pathophysiology of Toulouse Purpan, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Faguer', 'firstname': 'Stanislas', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Organ Transplantation, Toulouse Rangueil University Hospital, Toulouse, France.\nPaul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Izopet', 'firstname': 'Jacques', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Virology, Toulouse Purpan University Hospital, Toulouse, France.\nPaul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France.\nINSERM UMR1043, Center for Pathophysiology of Toulouse Purpan, Toulouse, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Kamar', 'firstname': 'Nassim', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Organ Transplantation, Toulouse Rangueil University Hospital, Toulouse, France.\nPaul Sabatier University, Toulouse, France.\nINSERM UMR1043, Center for Pathophysiology of Toulouse Purpan, Toulouse, France.'}]",None,"Due to high immunogenicity and safety of mRNA vaccines, we strongly recommend prioritizing a two-dose vaccination of dialysis patients.

368,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34043060,Chronic haemodialysis in infants and children less than 15 kg.,"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the most commonly used kidney replacement therapy in infants and young children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5. Chronic haemodialysis (cHD) is the alternative treatment when PD is not possible for technical reasons; however, the difficulties that may be encountered are challenging and require clinicians with specialist training and experience. This study aims to describe the clinical history, complications and outcomes in children < 15 kg on cHD.
A retrospective, descriptive study of the clinical records of patients weighing < 15 kg on cHD for more than 3 months. The reasons for CKD stage 5, age at start of treatment, duration of haemodialysis, anthropometric and metabolic variables, as well as vascular access, complications and clinical outcome were recorded.
Fifteen patients were included between 2006 and 2018 with a median age at start of cHD of 30 (interquartile range (IQR) 13, 39) months and median duration of 15 (IQR 7.5, 25.3) months. Five patients were younger than 2 years. The median weight at start of treatment was 11.2 (IQR 6.4, 12.8) kg. Forty-five tunneled catheters with a median survival of 106 days were used. The main cause of loss of vascular access was obstruction or displacement dysfunction (39%). The catheter-associated infection rate was 0.76 per 1000 catheter days. Ten patients received a successful kidney transplant, 4 were transferred to PD and one died from complications during abdominal surgery.

369,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34039506,Association between monocyte count to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.,"Previous studies had demonstrated that elevated monocyte count to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR), a novel marker of inflammation, was associated with higher cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and coronary heart disease. However, the association between MHR and mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) has received little attention. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between MHR and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in PD patients.
In this single center retrospective cohort study, PD patients who had catheter insertion in our PD center from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2016 were enrolled. All patients were divided into three groups according to the tertiles of baseline MHR levels and followed up until December 31, 2018. The associations of MHR levels with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards models. Of 1584 patients, mean age was 46.02 ± 14.65 years, 60.1% were male, and 24.2% had diabetes. The mean MHR level was 0.39 ± 0.23. During a median follow up time of 45.6 (24.6-71.8) months, 349 patients died, and 181 deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease. After adjusting for confounders, the highest MHR tertile was significantly associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality with a hazard ratio of 1.43 (95%CI = 1.06-1.93, P = 0.019), 1.54 (95%CI = 1.01-2.35, P = 0.046), respectively.

31093667",A Systematic Review of Scope and Consistency of Outcome Measures for Physical Fitness in Chronic Kidney Disease Trials.,"Impaired physical fitness is prevalent in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), associating with an increased risk of mortality, falls, and hospitalization. A plethora of physical fitness outcomes have been reported in randomized trials. This study aimed to assess the scope and consistency of physical fitness outcomes and outcome measures reported in trials in CKD.
A systematic review of randomized trials reporting physical fitness outcomes in adults with CKD (not requiring kidney replacement therapy) receiving hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplant recipients was conducted. Studies were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from 2000 to 2019. The scope, frequency, and characteristics of outcome measures were categorized and analyzed.
From 111 trials, 87 tests/measurements were used to evaluate 30 outcomes measures that reported on 23 outcomes, categorized into five domains of physical fitness: neuromuscular fitness (reported in 76% of trials), exercise capacity (64%), physiological-metabolic (49%), body composition (36%), and cardiorespiratory fitness (30%). Neuromuscular fitness was examined by 37 tests/measurements including the physical function component of questionnaires (27%), one-repetition maximum (9%), and hand-grip strength (9%). Outcome measures were assessed by lab-based (58% of all trials), field-based (31%), and patient-reported measures (11%), and commonly evaluated at 12 (30%), 26 (23%) and 52 weeks (10%), respectively.
There is large heterogeneity in the reporting of physical fitness outcomes, with inconsistencies particularly in the definitions of outcome measures. Standardization in the assessment of physical fitness will likely improve the comparability of trial outcomes and enhance clinical recommendations.","['exercise', 'kidney disease', 'outcomes', 'physical fitness', 'randomized controlled trials']",Kidney international reports,2021-05-21,"[{'lastname': 'Jegatheesan', 'firstname': 'Dev K', 'initials': 'DK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Australia.\nCentre for Kidney Disease Research, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Modderman', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiotherapy, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Krishnasamy', 'firstname': 'Rathika', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Kidney Disease Research, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Australia.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Sunshine Coast University Hospital, Birtinya, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Tong', 'firstname': 'Allison', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia.\nCentre for Kidney Disease Research, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Coombes', 'firstname': 'Jeff S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'School of Human Movement and Nutrition Sciences, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Viecelli', 'firstname': 'Andrea K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Australia.\nCentre for Kidney Disease Research, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'David W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Australia.\nCentre for Kidney Disease Research, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Isbel', 'firstname': 'Nicole', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Woolloongabba, Australia.\nCentre for Kidney Disease Research, The University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Australia.'}]",None,"There is large heterogeneity in the reporting of physical fitness outcomes, with inconsistencies particularly in the definitions of outcome measures.

372,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,34000713,Management of diabetes mellitus in dialysis patients: Obstacles and challenges.,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major health issue that is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The treatment of DKD is challenging given changes in blood glucose homeostasis, unclear accuracy of glucose metrics, and altered kinetics of the blood glucose-lowering medications. There is uncertainty surrounding the optimal glycemic target in this population although recent epidemiologic data suggest that HbA1c ranges of 6-8%, as well as 7-9%, are associated with increased survival rates among diabetic dialysis patients. Furthermore, the treatment of diabetes in patients maintained on dialysis is challenging, and many blood glucose-lowering medications are renally metabolized and excreted hence requiring dose adjustment or avoidance in dialysis patients.

374,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,33991037,Impact of a kidney-specific disease-specific care certification program on the institutional performance indicators of hospitals caring for patients with chronic kidney disease: A national data analysis.,"The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on the rise due to population aging and multimorbidity. Taiwan is particularly afflicted by this prevailing ailment. Although multidisciplinary pre-dialysis care has been implemented to halt CKD progression and reduce health-care utilization in Taiwan, more is needed to reduce the local burden of CKD.
The Taiwan Joint Commission initiated a kidney-care disease-specific care (DSC) certification program since 2017, aiming to improve participating hospitals' quality of care for kidney disease and to synchronize the quality of kidney care across Taiwan. We analysed the trend of changes over time among the kidney DSC certification program participating institutes during the period before, during, and after DSC certification program implementation, using the Generalized Estimating Equation methods.
A total of 20 institutes participated in the DSC certification program focusing on kidney diseases between January 2018 and March 2020, among which 70% were medical centres. DSC certification program was shown to significantly reduce the annual incidence of arteriovenous fistula reconstruction while increase the levels of serum albumin and haemoglobin among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under haemodialysis over time. For parameters related to peritoneal dialysis (PD), participating in the kidney-care DSC certification program significantly increased serum albumin levels among these patients with ESRD over time.
In this study, we discovered that a kidney-care DSC certification program significantly improved multiple performance indicators of participating institutes including patients' haemoglobin, albumin, and shunt re-creation probability among patients with end-stage renal disease.","['albumin', 'anaemia', 'chronic kidney disease', 'disease-specific care certificate', 'malnutrition', 'quality of care']","Nephrology (Carlton, Vic.)",2021-05-16,"[{'lastname': 'Chao', 'firstname': 'Chia-Ter', 'initials': 'CT', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital BeiHu Branch, Taipei, Taiwan.\nNephrology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.\nGraduate Institute of Toxicology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Ching-I', 'initials': 'CI', 'affiliation': 'Division of Quality Improvement, Joint Commission of Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Pa-Chun', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': 'Chief Executive Officer Office, Joint Commission of Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan.\nQuality Management Center, Cathay General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chiang', 'firstname': 'Ching-Feng', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': 'Chief Executive Officer Office, Joint Commission of Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Chia-Pei', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Division of Quality Improvement, Joint Commission of Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hsu', 'firstname': 'Hui-Shu', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Chief Executive Officer Office, Joint Commission of Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hung', 'firstname': 'Kuan-Yu', 'initials': 'KY', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}]",None,"In this study, we discovered that a kidney-care DSC certification program significantly improved multiple performance indicators of participating institutes including patients' haemoglobin, albumin, and shunt re-creation probability among patients with end-stage renal disease.","A total of 20 institutes participated in the DSC certification program focusing on kidney diseases between January 2018 and March 2020, among which 70% were medical centres.

This study's aim was to describe the clinical profile, management, and long-term outcome of the genetic aHUS patients admitted to a tertiary care pediatric nephrology center during 20 years.
We performed a retrospective analysis of the clinical records of all aHUS patients younger than 18 years with identified genetic mutations. Data on clinical features, genetic study, therapeutic interventions, and long-term outcomes were reviewed.
Five cases of aHUS with an identified genetic mutation were included; all were inaugural cases with the youngest being 4 months old. Complement factor H gene mutation was identified in four patients. Therapeutic plasma exchange was performed for acute management in 4 patients, one of whom also needed acute renal replacement therapy (peritoneal dialysis). All patients went on complete remission, 2 had more than one relapse but only 1 of these progressed to chronic kidney disease during the follow-up period (median (25th-75th percentile), 136 (43.5-200.5) months).
In children, the prognosis of renal function seems to be strongly dependent on the genetic background, thus being crucial to perform genetic study in all aHUS cases. In our cohort, 2 patients presented genetic mutations not previously described. Recent innovations on the genetic field leading to the identification of new mutations has lead to a better understanding of aHUS pathogenesis, but further studies, focusing on the genotype-phenotype correlation, with longer follow-up periods, are needed.
A síndrome hemolítica urêmica atípica (SHUa) é um distúrbio raro caracterizado pela tríade de anemia hemolítica microangiopática, trombocitopenia e lesão renal aguda, afetando principalmente crianças em idade pré-escolar. O objetivo deste estudo foi descrever perfil clínico, manejo e desfecho em longo prazo dos pacientes com SHUa genética admitidos em um centro terciário de nefrologia pediátrica durante 20 anos.
Realizamos análise retrospectiva dos registros clínicos de todos os pacientes com SHUa menores de 18 anos com mutações genéticas identificadas. Revisaram-se dados sobre características clínicas, estudo genético, intervenções terapêuticas e desfechos em longo prazo.
Incluíram-se cinco casos de SHUa com uma mutação genética identificada; sendo todos casos inaugurais, o mais jovem tendo 4 meses de idade. A mutação no gene do fator H do complemento foi identificada em quatro pacientes. Plasmaférese terapêutica foi realizada para tratamento agudo em 4 pacientes, um dos quais também necessitou terapia renal substitutiva aguda (diálise peritoneal). Todos os pacientes tiveram remissão completa, 2 mais de uma recidiva, mas apenas 1 evoluiu para doença renal crônica durante acompanhamento (mediana (percentil 25°-75°), 136 (43,5-200,5) meses).
Em crianças, o prognóstico da função renal parece ser fortemente dependente do histórico genético, sendo crucial realizar estudo genético em todos os casos de SHUa. Em nossa coorte, 2 pacientes apresentaram mutações genéticas não descritas anteriormente.

30904051","International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas: structures, organization, and services for the management of kidney failure in Western Europe.","Populations in the high-income countries of Western Europe are aging due to increased life expectancy. As the prevalence of diabetes and obesity has increased, so has the burden of kidney failure. To determine the global capacity for kidney replacement therapy and conservative kidney management, the International Society of Nephrology conducted multinational, cross-sectional surveys and published the findings in the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas. In the second iteration of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas, we aimed to describe the availability, accessibility, quality, and affordability of kidney failure care in Western Europe. Among the 29 countries in Western Europe, 21 (72.4%) responded, representing 99% of the region's population. The burden of kidney failure prevalence varied widely, ranging from 760 per million population (pmp) in Iceland to 1612 pmp in Portugal. Coverage of kidney replacement therapy from public funding was nearly universal, with the exceptions of Germany and Liechtenstein where part of the costs was covered by mandatory insurance. Fourteen (67%) of 21 countries charged no fees at the point of care delivery, but in 5 countries (24%), patients do pay some out-of-pocket costs. Long-term dialysis services (both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) were available in all countries in the region, and kidney transplantation services were available in 19 (90%) countries. The incidence of kidney transplantation varied widely between countries from 12 pmp in Luxembourg to 70.45 pmp in Spain. Conservative kidney care was available in 18 (90%) of 21 countries. The median number of nephrologists was 22.9 pmp (range: 9.47-55.75 pmp).

29570911","International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas: structures, organization, and services for the management of kidney failure in South Asia.","Information about disease burden and the available infrastructure and workforce to care for patients with kidney disease was collected for the second edition of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas. This paper presents findings for the 8 countries in the South Asia region. The World Bank categorizes Afghanistan and Nepal as low-income; Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Pakistan as lower-middle-income; and Sri Lanka and the Maldives as upper-middle-income countries. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in South Asia ranged from 5.01% to 13.24%. Long-term hemodialysis and long-term peritoneal dialysis are available in all countries, but Afghanistan lacks peritoneal dialysis services. Kidney transplantation was available in all countries except Bhutan and Maldives. Hemodialysis was the dominant modality of long-term dialysis, peritoneal dialysis was more expensive than hemodialysis, and kidney transplantation overwhelmingly depended on living donors. Bhutan provided public funding for kidney replacement therapy (dialysis and transplantation); Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh had variable funding mechanisms; and Afghanistan relied solely on out-of-pocket expenditure. There were shortages of health care personnel across the entire region. Reporting was variable: Afghanistan and Sri Lanka have dialysis registries but publish no reports, whereas Bangladesh has a transplant registry. South Asia has a large, but poorly documented burden of CKD. Diabetes and hypertension are the major causes of CKD throughout the region with a higher prevalence of infectious causes in Afghanistan and a high burden of CKD of an unknown cause in Sri Lanka and parts of India. The extent and quality of care delivery is suboptimal and variable. Sustainable strategies need to be developed to address the growing burden of CKD in the region.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'kidney failure', 'kidney registries', 'kidney

26798456","International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas: structures, organization, and services for the management of kidney failure in North America and the Caribbean.","The International Society of Nephrology established the Global Kidney Health Atlas project to define the global capacity for kidney replacement therapy and conservative kidney care, and this second iteration was to describe the availability, accessibility, quality, and affordability of kidney failure (KF) care worldwide. This report presents results for the International Society of Nephrology North America and the Caribbean region. Relative to other regions, the North America and Caribbean region had better infrastructure and funding for health care and more health care workers relative to the population. Various essential medicines were also more available and accessible. There was substantial variation in the prevalence of treated KF in the region, ranging from 137.4 per million population (pmp) in Jamaica to 2196 pmp in the United States. A mix of public and private funding systems cover costs for nondialysis chronic kidney disease care in 60% of countries and for dialysis in 70% of countries. Although the median number of nephrologists is 18.1 (interquartile range, 15.3-29.5) pmp, which is approximately twice the global median of 9.9 (interquartile range, 1.2-22.7) pmp, some countries reported shortages of other health care workers. Dialysis was available in all countries, but peritoneal dialysis was underutilized and unavailable in Barbados, Cayman Islands, and Turks and Caicos. Kidney transplantation was primarily available in Canada and the United States. Economic factors were the major barriers to optimal KF care in the Caribbean countries, and few countries in the region have chronic kidney disease-specific national health care policies. To address regional gaps in KF care delivery, efforts should be directed toward augmenting the workforce, improving the monitoring and reporting of kidney replacement therapy indicators, and implementing noncommunicable disease and chronic kidney disease-specific policies in all countries.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'funding', 'kidney failure', 'kidney registries',

This work summarized and presented demographics, health information systems, statistics, and national health policy of the region, as well as characteristics of the burden of chronic kidney disease and kidney failure (KF) of participating countries. Besides significant economic advancement in the region, the collected data revealed existing shortage in KF care providers, essential medications, and health product access for KF care. Moreover, there was low reporting of kidney replacement therapy (dialysis and kidney transplantation) quality indicators and low capacity for long-term hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplantation.

29496507","International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas: structures, organization, and services for the management of kidney failure in the Middle East.","Kidney failure is the permanent impairment of kidney function associated with increased morbidity, hospitalization, and requirement for kidney replacement therapy. A total of 11 countries in the Middle East region (84.6%) responded to the survey. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease in the region ranged from 5.2% to 10.6%, whereas prevalence of treated kidney failure ranged from 152 to 826 per million population. Overall, the incidence of kidney transplantation was highest in Iran (30.9 per million population) and lowest in Oman and the United Arab Emirates (2.2 and 3.0 per million population, respectively). Long-term hemodialysis services were available in all countries, long-term peritoneal dialysis services were available in 9 (69.2%) countries, and transplantation services were available in most countries of the region. Public funding covered the costs of nondialysis chronic kidney disease care in two-thirds of countries, and kidney replacement therapy in nearly all countries. More than half of the countries had dialysis registries; however, national noncommunicable disease strategies were lacking in most countries. The Middle East is a region with high burden of kidney disease and needs cost-effective measures through effective health care funding to be available to improve kidney care in the region. Furthermore, well-designed and sustainable health information systems are needed in the region to address current gaps in kidney care in the region.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'funding', 'kidney failure', 'kidney registries', 'workforce']",Kidney international supplements,2021-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Amouzegar', 'firstname': 'Atefeh', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Firoozgar Clinical Research Development Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Abu-Alfa', 'firstname': 'Ali K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.'}, {'lastname': 'Alrukhaimi', 'firstname': 'Mona N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Dubai Medical College, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.'}, {'lastname': 'Bello', 'firstname': 'Aminu K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghnaimat', 'firstname': 'Mohammad A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, The Specialty Hospital, Amman, Jordan.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'David W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Metro South and Ipswich Nephrology and Transplant Services, Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nCentre for Kidney Disease Research, University of Queensland at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nTranslation Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Jha', 'firstname': 'Vivekanand', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales, New Delhi, India.\nSchool of Public Health, Imperial College, London, UK.\nManipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'David C H', 'initials': 'DCH', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Transplantation and Renal Research, The Westmead Institute for Medical Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Levin', 'firstname': 'Adeera', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tonelli', 'firstname': 'Marcello', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nPan-American Health Organization/World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre in Prevention and Control of Chronic Kidney Disease, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Lunney', 'firstname': 'Meaghan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Saad', 'firstname': 'Syed', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Khan', 'firstname': 'Maryam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Zaidi', 'firstname': 'Deenaz', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Osman', 'firstname': 'Mohamed A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ye', 'firstname': 'Feng', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Okpechi', 'firstname': 'Ikechi G', 'initials': 'IG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\nDivision of Nephrology and Hypertension, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.\nKidney and Hypertension Research Unit, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Ossareh', 'firstname': 'Shahrzad', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Hasheminejad Kidney Center, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,© 2021 International Society of Nephrology.

27086173","International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas: structures, organization, and services for the management of kidney failure in Latin America.","Latin America is a region with a widely variable socioeconomic landscape, facing a surge in noncommunicable diseases, including chronic kidney disease and kidney failure, exposing significant limitations in the delivery of care. Despite region-wide efforts to explore and address these limitations, much uncertainty remains as to the capacity, accessibility, and quality of kidney failure care in Latin America. Through this second iteration of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas, we aimed to report on these indicators to provide a comprehensive map of kidney failure care in the region. Survey responses were received from 18 (64.2%) countries, representing 93.8% of the total population in Latin America. The median prevalence and incidence of treated kidney failure in Latin America were 715 and 157 per million population, respectively, the latter being higher than the global median (142 per million population), with Puerto Rico, Mexico, and El Salvador experiencing much of this growing burden. In most countries, public and private systems collectively funded most aspects of kidney replacement therapy (dialysis and transplantation) care, with patients incurring at least 1% to 25% of out-of-pocket costs. In most countries, >90% of dialysis patients able to access kidney replacement therapy received hemodialysis (n = 11; 5 high income and 6 upper-middle income), and only a small minority began with peritoneal dialysis (1%-10% in 67% of countries; n = 12). Few countries had chronic kidney disease registries or targeted detection programs. There is a large variability in the availability, accessibility, and quality of kidney failure care in Latin America, which appears to be subject to individual countries' funding structures, underreliance on cheap kidney replacement therapy, such as peritoneal dialysis, and limited chronic kidney disease surveillance and management initiatives.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis',

There is an inequality in the global distribution of wealth and resources needed to provide this care. In this second iteration of the International Society of Nephrology Global Kidney Health Atlas, we present data for countries in Eastern and Central Europe. In the region, the median prevalence of chronic kidney disease was 13.15% and treated KF was 764 per million population, respectively, slightly higher than the global median of 759 per million population. In most countries in the region, over 90% of dialysis patients were on hemodialysis and patients with a functioning graft represented less than one-third of total patients with treated KF. The median annual costs for maintenance hemodialysis were close to the global median, and public funding provided nearly universal coverage of the costs of kidney replacement therapy. Nephrologists were primarily responsible for KF care. All countries had the capacity to provide long-term hemodialysis, and 95% had the capacity to provide peritoneal dialysis. Home hemodialysis was generally not available. Kidney transplantation and conservative care were available across most of the region. Almost all countries had official dialysis and transplantation registries. Eastern and Central Europe is a region with a high burden of chronic kidney disease and variable capacity to deal with it. Insufficient funding and workforce shortages coupled with increasing comorbidities among aging patients and underutilization of cost-effective dialysis therapies such as peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation may compromise the quality of care for patients with KF. Some workforce shortages could be addressed by improving the organization of nephrological care in some countries of the region.","['GKHA', 'epidemiology', 'hemodialysis', 'kidney care funding', 'kidney transplantation', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Kidney international supplements,2021-05-14,"[{'lastname': 'Dębska-Ślizień', 'firstname': 'Alicja', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Transplantation and Internal Medicine, Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Bello', 'firstname': 'Aminu K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Immunology, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'David W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Metro South and Ipswich Nephrology and Transplant Services (MINTS), Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nCentre for Kidney Disease Research, University of Queensland at Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.\nTranslation Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Jha', 'firstname': 'Vivekanand', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'George Institute for Global Health, University of New South Wales (UNSW), New Delhi, India.\nSchool of Public Health, Imperial College, London, UK.\nManipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Harris', 'firstname': 'David C H', 'initials': 'DCH', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Transplantation and Renal Research, The Westmead Institute for Medical Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Levin', 'firstname': 'Adeera', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Tonelli', 'firstname': 'Marcello', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nPan-American Health Organization/World Health Organization's Collaborating Centre in Prevention and Control of Chronic Kidney Disease, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Saad', 'firstname': 'Syed', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Zaidi', 'firstname': 'Deenaz', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Osman', 'firstname': 'Mohamed A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ye', 'firstname': 'Feng', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Khan', 'firstname': 'Maryam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Lunney', 'firstname': 'Meaghan', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Okpechi', 'firstname': 'Ikechi G', 'initials': 'IG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.\nDivision of Nephrology and Hypertension, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.\nKidney and Hypertension Research Unit, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Turan Kazancioglu', 'firstname': 'Rumeyza', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Bezmialem Vakif University, Istanbul, Turkey.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,© 2021 International Society of Nephrology.

Subjects received daprodustat 4 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks and the dose was subsequently adjusted every 4 weeks. Mean baseline hemoglobin was 10.9 g/dL (95% CI 10.59, 11.12). Mean hemoglobin reached the target range (11.0-13.0 g/dL) at week 12 and was maintained until week 52. Mean hemoglobin during weeks 40-52 was 12.1 g/dL (95% CI 12.0, 12.2). The most frequent adverse events included nasopharyngitis (29%), catheter-site infection (18%), peritonitis (16%), diarrhea (14%), and nausea (11%). No deaths were reported.

386,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,33931942,Gastrointestinal symptom burden and dietary intake in patients with chronic kidney disease.,"Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms can present a significant burden to patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) but the reported prevalence is inconsistent.
To examine the GI burden and dietary intake in patients with CKD with or without dialysis.
This was a cross-sectional study of 216 adults, recruited from outpatient and dialysis clinics, with CKD stage 4 or 5 not receiving dialysis (CKD-ND), or receiving haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Three questionnaires were administered: the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS); a modified Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale and a short Food Frequency Questionnaire. Outcomes were stool frequency and consistency, GI symptoms and dietary intake.
Data were collected from 216 patients (mean age, 63 years [95% CI: 61, 65]; 63% males; CKD-ND: n = 134; HD: n = 67; PD: n = 15). Mean stool frequency for all groups was one bowel action per day (p = .45) and consistency was normal (BSFS type 4, p = .95). Overall GI symptom burden was low but several symptoms occurred at least ""most of the time"" including ""tiredness/lethargy"" (54% of participants), ""reduced appetite"" (29%), ""early satiety"" (25%) and ""change in taste"" (15%). Low intakes of fresh fruit, vegetables, whole-grains and legumes were found. No associations were observed between diet and GI symptoms.
The overall GI symptom burden was low, but >15% of participants reported several symptoms as occurring most to all of the time. Low intakes of fresh fruit, vegetables, whole-grains and legumes were observed in all CKD patients.","['chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'diarrhoea', 'diet', 'gastrointestinal symptoms']",Journal of renal care,2021-05-02,"[{'lastname': 'Meade', 'firstname': 'Anthony', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Central Northern Adelaide Renal and Transplantation Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Le Leu', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Central Northern Adelaide Renal and Transplantation Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.\nSchool of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Watson', 'firstname': 'Nerylee', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Central Northern Adelaide Renal and Transplantation Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Jesudason', 'firstname': 'Shilpa', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Central Northern Adelaide Renal and Transplantation Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.\nSchool of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Clayton', 'firstname': 'Philip', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Central Northern Adelaide Renal and Transplantation Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.\nSchool of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Faull', 'firstname': 'Randall', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Central Northern Adelaide Renal and Transplantation Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.\nSchool of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'McDonald', 'firstname': 'Stephen', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Central Northern Adelaide Renal and Transplantation Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.\nSchool of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Trimingham', 'firstname': 'Claire', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Central Northern Adelaide Renal and Transplantation Service, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.'}]",None,"The overall GI symptom burden was low, but >15% of participants reported several symptoms as occurring most to all of the time.

8583582","Multifaceted Sexual Dysfunction in Dialyzing Men and Women: Pathophysiology, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics.","Patient survival continues to increase with the growing quality of dialysis and management of chronic kidney disease (CKD). As such, chronic therapy must include considerations of quality of life (QOL), and this includes the disproportionate prevalence of sexual dysfunction (SD) in this patient population. This review aims to describe the pathophysiological and the psychosocial causes of SD with regard to renal replacement therapy, particularly hemo- and peritoneal dialysis. The differences in its manifestation in men and women are compared, including hormonal imbalances-and therefore fertility, libido, and sexual satisfaction-the experience of depression and anxiety, and QOL. The impact of comorbidities and the iatrogenic causes of SD are described. This review also presents validated scales for screening and diagnosis of SD in CKD patients and outlines novel therapies and strategies for the effective management of SD. Increased prevalence of CKD invariably increases the number of patients with SD, and it is crucial for health care professional teams to become familiar with the clinical tools used to manage this sensitive and under-quantified field. As a known predictor of QOL, sexual function should become a point of focus in the pursuit of patient-centered care, particularly as we seek to achieve as ""normal"" a life as possible for individuals who receive dialysis.","['CKD', 'Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)', 'International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)', 'dialysis', 'erectile dysfunction', 'fertility', 'quality of life', 'renal replacement therapy', 'renal transplant', 'sexual dysfunction']","Life (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Chou', 'firstname': 'Jadzia', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephology, Transplantology and Internal Medicine, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-355 Poznan, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiebalo', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephology, Transplantology and Internal Medicine, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-355 Poznan, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Jagiello', 'firstname': 'Piotr', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephology, Transplantology and Internal Medicine, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-355 Poznan, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pawlaczyk', 'firstname': 'Krzysztof', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephology, Transplantology and Internal Medicine, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, 60-355 Poznan, Poland.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/life11040311

24588981",The Psychosocial and Somatic Effects of Relocation from Remote Canadian First Nation Communities to Urban Centres on Indigenous Peoples with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).,"Chronic kidney disease, also referred to as end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is a prevalent and chronic condition for which treatment is necessary as a means of survival once affected individuals reach the fifth and final stage of the disease. Dialysis is a form of maintenance treatment that aids with kidney functioning once a normal kidney is damaged. There are two main types of dialysis: hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Each form of treatment is discussed between the patient and nephrologist and is largely dependent upon the following factors: medical condition, ability to administer treatment, supports, geographical location, access to necessary equipment/supplies, personal wishes, etc. For Indigenous Peoples who reside on remote Canadian First Nation communities, relocation is often recommended due to geographical location and limited access to both health care professionals and necessary equipment/supplies (i.e., quality of water, access to electricity/plumbing, etc.). Consequently, the objective of this paper is to determine the psychosocial and somatic effects for Indigenous Peoples with ESRD if they have to relocate from remote First Nation communities to an urban centre. A review of the literature suggests that relocation to urban centres has negative implications that are worth noting: cultural isolation, alienation from family and friends, somatic issues, psychosocial issues, loss of independence and role adjustment. As a result of relocation, it is evident that the impact is profound in terms of an individuals' mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well-being. Ensuring that adequate social support and education are available to patients and families would aid in alleviating stressors associated with managing chronic kidney disease.","['Canadian', 'Northern', 'chronic kidney disease', 'dialysis', 'end-stage renal disease', 'indigenous', 'relocation', 'remote', 'renal failure', 'rural', 'urban']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Genereux', 'firstname': 'Denise', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Social Work, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Fan', 'firstname': 'Lida', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'School of Social Work, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Brownlee', 'firstname': 'Keith', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Social Work, Lakehead University, Orillia, ON L3V 0B9, Canada.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/ijerph18073838

29993277",A Uremic Goat Model Created by Subtotal Renal Artery Embolization and Gentamicin.,"A large animal model of (end-stage) kidney disease (ESKD) is needed for the preclinical testing of novel renal replacement therapies. This study aimed to create stable uremia via subtotal renal artery embolization in goats and induce a temporary further decline in kidney function by administration of gentamicin. Renal artery embolization was performed in five Dutch white goats by infusing polyvinyl alcohol particles in branches of the renal artery, aiming for the embolization of ~80% of one kidney and complete embolization of the contralateral kidney. Gentamicin was administered to temporarily further increase the plasma concentrations of uremic toxins. After initial acute kidney injury, urea and creatinine plasma concentrations stabilized 1.5 ± 0.7 months post-embolization and remained elevated (12 ± 1.4 vs. 5.6 ± 0.8 mmol/L and 174 ± 45 vs. 65 ± 5.6 µmol/L, resp.) during follow-up (16 ± 6 months). Gentamicin induced temporary acute-on-chronic kidney injury with a variable increase in plasma concentrations of small solutes (urea 29 ± 15 mmol/L, creatinine 841 ± 584 µmol/L, phosphate 2.2 ± 0.3 mmol/L and potassium 5.0 ± 0.6 mmol/L) and protein-bound uremic toxins representative of patients with ESKD. A uremic goat model characterized by stable moderate uremia was established via subtotal renal artery embolization with the induction of temporary severe acute-on-chronic kidney injury by the administration of gentamicin, allowing preclinical in vivo validation of novel renal replacement technologies.","['animal', 'chronic kidney disease', 'embolization', 'gentamicin', 'hemodialysis', 'models', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Biology,2021-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'van Gelder', 'firstname': 'Maaike K', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'de Vries', 'firstname': 'Joost C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Ahmed', 'firstname': 'Sabbir', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Universiteitsweg 99, 3584 CG Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Monninkhof', 'firstname': 'Anneke S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'de Kort', 'firstname': 'Gérard A P', 'initials': 'GAP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Vonken', 'firstname': 'Evert-Jan P A', 'initials': 'EPA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Hazenbrink', 'firstname': 'Diënty H M', 'initials': 'DHM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Vaessen', 'firstname': 'Koen R D', 'initials': 'KRD', 'affiliation': 'Central Laboratory Animal Research Facility, Utrecht University, Heidelberglaan 8, 3584 CS Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Tri Q', 'initials': 'TQ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Verhaar', 'firstname': 'Marianne C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Joles', 'firstname': 'Jaap A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Gerritsen', 'firstname': 'Karin G F', 'initials': 'KGF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology and Hypertension, University Medical Center Utrecht, Heidelberglaan 100, 3584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/biology10040292

This study aimed to estimate the effect of calendar time on technique survival, transfer to hemodialysis (HD) (and the individual causes of transfer), and patient survival.
This retrospective, multicenter study, based on data from the French Language Peritoneal Dialysis Registry, analyzed 14,673 patients who initiated PD in France between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2016. Adjusted Cox regressions with robust variance were used to examine the probability of a composite end point of either death or transfer to HD, death, and transfer to HD, accounting for the nonlinear impact of PD start time.
There were 10,201 (69.5%) cases of PD cessation over the study period: 5,495 (37.4%) deaths and 4,706 (32.1%) transfers to HD. The rate of PD cessation due to death or transfer to HD decreased over time (PR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95-0.97). Compared to 2009-2010, starting PD between 2005 and 2008 or 2011 and 2016 was strongly associated with a lower rate of transfer to HD (PR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96, and PR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84-0.99, respectively), mostly due to a decline in the rate of infection-related transfers to HD (PR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.98).
Rates of the composite end point of either death or transfer to HD, death, and transfer to HD have decreased in recent decades. The decline in transfers to HD rates, observed since 2011, is mainly the result of a significant decline in infection-related transfers.","['Assistance', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Longitudinal trends', 'Peritoneal dialysis', 'Technique survival']",American journal of nephrology,2021-04-28,"[{'lastname': 'Boyer', 'firstname': 'Annabel', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre Universitaire des Maladies Rénales, CHU de Caen, Caen, France.\nU1086 INSERM, ANTICIPE, Centre Régional de Lutte contre le Cancer, François Baclesse, Caen, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Lanot', 'firstname': 'Antoine', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre Universitaire des Maladies Rénales, CHU de Caen, Caen, France.\nU1086 INSERM, ANTICIPE, Centre Régional de Lutte contre le Cancer, François Baclesse, Caen, France.\nNormandie Université, Unicaen, UFR de médecine, Caen, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Lambie', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Renal Unit, Royal Stoke University Hospital, University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom.\nFaculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Keele University, Newcastle, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Verger', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'RDPLF, Pontoise, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Guillouet', 'firstname': 'Sonia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centre Universitaire des Maladies Rénales, CHU de Caen, Caen, France.\nU1086 INSERM, ANTICIPE, Centre Régional de Lutte contre le Cancer, François Baclesse, Caen, France.\nNormandie Université, Unicaen, UFR de médecine, Caen, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Lobbedez', 'firstname': 'Thierry', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Centre Universitaire des Maladies Rénales, CHU de Caen, Caen, France.\nU1086 INSERM, ANTICIPE, Centre Régional de Lutte contre le Cancer, François Baclesse, Caen, France.\nNormandie Université, Unicaen, UFR de médecine, Caen, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Béchade', 'firstname': 'Clémence', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Centre Universitaire des Maladies Rénales, CHU de Caen, Caen, France.\nU1086 INSERM, ANTICIPE, Centre Régional de Lutte contre le Cancer, François Baclesse, Caen, France.\nNormandie Université, Unicaen, UFR de médecine, Caen, France.'}]",None,None,"There were 10,201 (69.5%) cases of PD cessation over the study period: 5,495 (37.4%) deaths and 4,706 (32.1%) transfers to HD.

391,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,33901377,[The technology of enhancement of detection of chronic renal diseases].,"The chronic kidney disease takes a special place among chronic non-communicable diseases because it is characterized by wide prevalence worldwide. However, its detection rate among Moscow adult population is 1%, though in the European countries this indicator is significantly higher and is made up on average to 6%. At the terminal stage of chronic kidney disease, quality of life of such patients decreases dramatically, that result in working capacity loss and disability. These patients often require expensive methods of programmed hemo- and peritoneal dialysis. The corresponding mortality is much higher as compared with total mortality. Among the frequent causes of hospitalization and mortality of such patients, complications of blood circulation system diseases are registered. The existing problem of low detection of kidney pathology in the population is the main cause of untimely treatment start. The rapid disease progression results in higher indices of premature mortality and increased costs of treatment of patients with this pathology. The timely diagnosis of disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism permits to identify chronic kidney disease at an early stage and to start to carry out adequate treatment and prevention measures. The purpose of the study is to implement the technology of improving efficiency of detection of chronic kidney disease. Methods. The organizational experiment, analytical, mathematical and statistical research methods. Results of the study. The detection rate of chronic kidney disease amounted to 8%. Among the respondents with chronic kidney disease diagnosed, more than 80% had initial stages of disease (I-III). In this case, appropriate therapy and prevention can prolong kidney functioning and reduce velocity of disease progression. At the same time, 16.3% of patients at the late stage of diseases progression (stages IV-V) were identified.The detection rate for all stages of chronic kidney disease increases with age Conclusions. The level of detection of chronic kidney disease in the base territory is comparable with the indices established in the European countries. The need to improve quality of diagnostic and prevention of chronic kidney disease was proven. To improve overall prognosis and prevention of development of terminal renal failure is possible only in case of brigade approach to treatment including active interaction of cardiologist and nephrologist, endocrinologist and nephrologist or of all these three specialists. Scope of the results. The established higher detection rate of chronic kidney disease (8%), as compared to actual one (1%), permits to claim that with systematic improvement of diagnosis, the detection of chronic kidney disease will increase iteratively and population need for nephrologic medical care will significantly increase that will require increasing in resource support and revising of planned and normative indices for this type of medical care.","['chronic kidney disease', 'detection and prevention', 'hemodialysis', 'renal failure', 'terminal stage']","Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",2021-04-27,"[{'lastname': 'Kotenko', 'firstname': 'O N', 'initials': 'ON', 'affiliation': 'City Clinical Hospital No. 52 of the Moscow Healthcare Department, 123182, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Serdyukovskiy', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'N.

21257858",Hematocrit Sign Elucidates Cause of Abdominal Pain.,"A 78-year-old male with chronic kidney disease on peritoneal dialysis developed unprovoked bilateral pulmonary embolisms. He was started on IV unfractionated heparin, but shortly thereafter developed severe pain and a small firm abdominal nodule near his dialysis catheter site. The diagnosis was unknown, and the initial plan was watchful waiting, until point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was used. POCUS revealed an ovoid mass with hyperdensity in the gravity dependent regions with spontaneous movement. This appearance was classic for the hematocrit sign. When combined with the clinical presentation, this was concerning for a rectus sheath hematoma. An urgent CT of the abdomen confirmed this several hours later. POCUS allowed for rapid bedside diagnosis, which expedited appropriate care in a potentially life-threatening situation.","['POCUS', 'hematocrit sign', 'kidney disease']",POCUS journal,2021-04-22,"[{'lastname': 'Lam', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Queen's University Kingston, Ontario Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Montague', 'firstname': 'Steven', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Department of Medicine, Division of General Internal Medicine, Queen's University Kingston, Ontario Canada.""}]",None,None,None,Author(s) retain the copyright for their work.,10.24908/pocus.v6i1.14751,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x28862de40>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,36895502,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36895502,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

Observational cohort study.
7,771 hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) participants from 6 countries participating in the Peritoneal and Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Studies (PDOPPS/DOPPS).
Patient-reported functional status (based on daily living activities), country, demographic and clinical characteristics, and comorbidities.
Employment status and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) including Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL) instrument physical and mental component summary scores (PCS, MCS), kidney disease burden score, and depression symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES-D] score > 10).
Linear regression (PCS, MCS, kidney disease burden score), logistic regression (depression symptoms), adjusted for predictors plus 12 additional comorbidities.
In both dialysis modalities, patients in Japan had the highest PCS and employment (55% for HD and 68% for PD), whereas those in the United States had the highest MCS score, lowest kidney disease burden, and lowest employment (20% in HD and 42% in PD). After covariate adjustment, the association of age, sex, dialysis vintage, diabetes, and functional status with PROs was similar in both modalities, with women having lower PCS and kidney disease burden scores. Lower functional status (score <11) was strongly associated with lower PCS and MCS scores, a much greater burden of kidney disease, and greater likelihood of depression symptoms (CES-D, >10). The median change in KDQOL-based PROs was negligible over 1 year in participants who completed at least 2 annual questionnaires.
Selection bias due to incomplete survey responses. Generalizability was limited to the dialysis populations of the included countries.
Variation exists in quality of life, burden of kidney disease, and depression across countries but did not appreciably change over time. Functional status remained one of the strongest predictors of all PROs. Routine assessment of functional status may provide valuable insights for patients and providers in anticipating outcomes and support needs for patients receiving either PD or HD.","['Chronic kidney disease (CKD)', 'KRT modality', 'depression', 'disease burden', 'employment', 'end-stage renal disease (ESRD)', 'functional status', 'international comparisons', 'kidney replacement therapy (KRT)', 'mental well-being', 'patient-reported outcomes (PROs)', 'peritoneal dialysis (PD)', 'quality of life (QOL)']",American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,2021-04-20,"[{'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Edwina A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Imperial College Renal and Transplant Centre, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Junhui', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Arbor Research Collaborative for Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan.'}, {'lastname': 'McCullough', 'firstname': 'Keith', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Arbor Research Collaborative for Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fuller', 'firstname': 'Douglas S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Arbor Research Collaborative for Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan.'}, {'lastname': 'Figueiredo', 'firstname': 'Ana E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Sciences and Life, Nursing School, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Bieber', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Arbor Research Collaborative for Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan.'}, {'lastname': 'Finkelstein', 'firstname': 'Frederic O', 'initials': 'FO', 'affiliation': 'Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.'}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Jenny', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology and Hypertension, LaBiomed at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Kanjanabuch', 'firstname': 'Talerngsak', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Center of Excellence in Kidney Metabolic Disorders and Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Kawanishi', 'firstname': 'Hideki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Tsuchiya General Hospital, Nakaku, Hiroshima, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Pisoni', 'firstname': 'Ronald L', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Arbor Research Collaborative for Health, Ann Arbor, Michigan.'}, {'lastname': 'Perl', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""St. Michael's Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

CKD patients need to choose one of these therapies to improve their quality of life. This study aims to investigate differences in the quality of life of chronic kidney disease patients undergoing hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).
The study design used is similar to the cross-sectional design. Therefore, in this study observations were carried out, a EQ_5D life quality questionnaire sheet was administered to respondents, and a purposive sampling method was used. The total number of respondents was 250 and consisted of 125 hemodialysis and CAPD patients each.
The results obtained using the Mann Whitney method was a p-value (0.515)> α (0.05). These results also included five components, namely the ability to move/walk to an acceptable degree, adequate self-care, performance of usual activities, minimal amount of pain/discomfort during hemodialysis and CAPD, and acceptable levels of anxiety/sadness.

Analysis of data from a cross sectional national survey; the UK Renal Registry (UKRR) national Kidney patient-reported experience measure (PREM) survey (2018). Centre-level data were obtained from the UKRR report (2018).
National survey of patients with advanced kidney disease receiving treatment with maintenance HD in UK renal centres in 2018.
The Kidney PREM was distributed to all UK renal centres by the UKRR in May 2018. Each centre invited patients receiving outpatient treatment for kidney disease to complete the PREM. These included patients with chronic kidney disease, those receiving dialysis-both HD and peritoneal dialysis, and those with a functioning kidney transplant. There were no formal inclusion/exclusion criteria.
The Kidney PREM has 38 questions in 13 subscales. Responses were captured using a 7-point Likert scale (
There were records for 8253 HD patients (61% men, 77% white) from 69 renal centres (9-710 patients per centre). There was significant variation in mean PREM score across centres (5.35-6.53). In the multivariable analysis there was some variation in relation to both patient- and centre-level factors but these contributed little to explaining the overall variation. However, multilevel modelling showed that the overwhelming proportion of the explained variance (45%) was explained by variation between centres (40%), only a small proportion of which is identified by measured factors. Only 5% of the variation was related to patient-level factors.
Centre rather than patient characteristics determine the experience of care of patients receiving HD.

396,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,33852223,[Urgent-start PD: a viable approach].,"Despite the many potential benefits of peritoneal dialysis (PD), the percentage of dialysis patients treated with PD is around 10% worldwide. Up to 70% of the subjects who progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) start dialysis without a well-defined therapy plan. Most of these patients are unaware of having chronic kidney disease, while others with stable CKD incur in unpredictable and acute worsening of kidney function. As a matter of fact, 80% of incident HD patients start dialysis with a central venous catheter (CVC) even though starting HD with a CVC is independently associated with increased mortality, high rates of bacteremia, and increased hospitalization rates. Thus, PD is an excellent but underused mode of dialysis. Offering it to patients who present late to dialysis therapy, due to uremic state or hypervolemia, may help increase its application in the future. This approach has been recently denominated ""urgent-start peritoneal dialysis"" (UPD). Based on the break-in period, it is possible to differentiate UPD from ""early-start peritoneal dialysis"" (EPD). The outcome of UPD depends on the right selection of patients, the appropriate placement of the catheter and the adequate education of the nursing and medical staff. Moreover, using modified catheter insertion technique aimed at creating a tight seal between the inner cuff and the abdominal tissues, as well as employing protocols that use low-volume exchanges in a supine posture, could minimize the occurrence of early mechanical complications. Although the probability of mechanical complications is higher in early-start PD patients, UPD/EPD show a mortality rate, a PD survival and an infectious complication rate comparable with conventional PD. In comparison to urgent-start hemodialysis via a CVC, UPD can be a safe and cost-effective alternative that decreases the incidences of catheter-related bloodstream infections and hemodialysis-related complications. Furthermore, UPD can promote the diffusion of PD.","['displacement', 'early-start', 'leakage', 'low-volume', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'urgent-start']",Giornale italiano di nefrologia : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di nefrologia,2021-04-15,"[{'lastname': 'Nardelli', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""UOC di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianti di Rene, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italia; Scuola di Specializzazione in Nefrologia, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italia.""}, {'lastname': 'Scalamogna', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""UOC di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianti di Rene, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italia.""}, {'lastname': 'Pisati', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""UOC di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianti di Rene, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italia.""}, {'lastname': 'Gallieni', 'firstname': 'Maurizio', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Scuola di Specializzazione in Nefrologia, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italia; UOC di Nefrologia e Dialisi, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milano, Italia.'}, {'lastname': 'Messa', 'firstname': 'Piergiorgio', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': ""UOC di Nefrologia, Dialisi e Trapianti di Rene, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italia; Scuola di Specializzazione in Nefrologia, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italia.""}]",None,None,None,"Copyright by Società Italiana di Nefrologia SIN, Rome, Italy.",None,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x2886659e0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,33852223,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33852223,0.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

Its survival rate and quality of life depend on the quality of dialysis. The quality of dialysis depends on the compliance of patients with drugs and dialysis treatment, the choice of diet, the detection of complications and the monitoring and management of the disease. Therefore, the self-management of PD patients is particularly important. This study explored the role of peer support in improving the self-management ability of PD patients.
A total of 105 PD patients in a Chinese tertiary hospital were enrolled and divided into a control group (35 cases), a WeChat group (intervention group 1; 35 cases), and a face-to-face group (intervention group 2; 35 cases). During the 6-month follow-up, the control group were given individualized education, and the intervention group was given peer support.
After the 6-month intervention, the self-management ability of the intervention group was significantly different from that of the control group (P<0.01). There were significant differences between the WeChat group and the face-to-face group with respect to hemoglobin and blood phosphorus (P<0.05).

This prospective, cross-sectional, descriptive, comparative, and analytical study of patients with stage 3-5 CKD, aged 8-18 years, assesses the association between patients' general and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and behavioral problems and their PCs' QoL and mental health status. PedsQL 4.0, PedsQL ESRD, CBCL, and YSR questionnaires were used to evaluate 80 patients while their PCs were assessed by SF-36 and MINI questionnaires. The study participants were divided into three groups: G1: stage 3-4 CKD, G2: peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, and G3: kidney transplantation.
Lower indexes in PedsQL 4.0 and PedsQL ESRD were demonstrated in G2 patients. No deviant internalizing and/or externalizing conducts were shown by the CBCL questionnaire while the YSR questionnaire demonstrated significant differences in all domains with higher scores in G2 patients without reaching clinical range for individual syndromes. G3 PCs presented the lowest SF-36 scores and the highest occurrence of psychiatric diagnoses, according to MINI, when compared to other PCs.

It is one of the most devastating diseases which has an enormous psychosocial and economic burden. The treatment available includes haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation. All treatment options have their pros and cons, needs and preferences, though haemodialysis is one of the most available entity in Pakistan. There are a few intrinsic problems associated with haemodialysis which has significant environmental as well as economic impact. One of the most important is the need of huge quantity of water to carry out the haemodialysis procedure along with production of solid waste in the form of disposables and electricity consumption. Peritoneal dialysis on the other hand is more environment-friendly and cost-effective and it should be one of the preferred options for our CKD patients.","[' Pakistan, haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, chronic kidney disease.\n']",JPMA.

ED can be caused by psychological factors in patients with regular dialysis therapy. Currently, Hemodialysis (HD) therapy is the first choice in dialysis therapy and only 2% of stage 5 CKD patients are using Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) as a dialysis therapy. ED in stage 5 CKD patients should become a part of the treatment of patients with dialysis, which hopefully will improve the quality of life of patients. This study aims to compare the improvement in ED degree in patients with HD and CAPD.
This study is an observational analytic comparative study involving 44 male patients with stage 5 CKD; 22 of whom underwent HD and the remaining 22 patients underwent CAPD. The differences evaluated were changes in the ED degree before and after dialysis, which were assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5).
There were significant differences in the improvement in ED degree and IIEF-5 scores in CAPD group. In the HD group, no significant difference was obtained in the improvement in ED degree and IIEF-5 score. A significant difference was obtained in the improvement in ED degree between the HD and CAPD groups by comparing the improvement in IIEF-5 score.
Patients with CAPD have a better improvement in ED degree than patients with HD. Duarsa GWK, Kandarini Y, Winarta GK, et al.

We prospectively followed 59 non-hemodialysis CKD patients with iron deficient anemia (IDA: hemoglobin <12.0/<13.5 g/dL in women/men and TSAT < 20% and/or ferritin < 100 ng/mL) who were intolerant or non-responders to oral iron. Patients received ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) (single dose of 500 mg) followed by additional doses if iron deficiency persisted. We evaluated efficacy of FCM in terms of increase of hemoglobin, ferritin, and TSAT levels. Direct and indirect costs of FCM were also analyzed in comparison with a hypothetical scenario where same amount of iron as ferric gluconate (FG) was administered intravenously. During the 24 weeks of study, 847 ± 428 mg of FCM per patient were administered. IDA improved after four weeks of FCM and remained stable thereafter. At week-24, mean change (95%CI) from baseline of hemoglobin, ferritin and TSAT were +1.16 g/dL (0.55-1.77), +104 ng/mL (40-168) and +9.5% (5.8-13.2), respectively. These changes were independent from ESA use and clinical setting (non-dialysis CKD, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplant).

32297981",Analysis of the Clinical and Epidemiological Meaning of Screening Test for SARS-CoV-2: Considerations in the Chronic Kidney Disease Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The COronaVIrus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is an emerging reality in nephrology. In a continuously changing scenario, we need to assess our patients' additional risk in terms of attending hemodialysis treatments, follow-up peritoneal dialysis, and kidney transplant visits. The prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-20 infection in the general population plays a pivotal role in estimating the additional COVID-19 risk in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Unfortunately, local prevalence is often obscure, and when we have an estimation, we neglect the number of asymptomatic subjects in the same area and, consequently, the risk of infection in CKD patients. Furthermore, we still have the problem of managing COVID-19 diagnosis and the test's accuracy. Currently, the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection is a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on respiratory tract samples. rRT-PCR presents some vulnerability related to pre-analytic and analytic problems and could impact strongly on its diagnostic accuracy. Specifically, the operative proceedings to obtain the samples and the different types of diagnostic assay could affect the results of the test. In this scenario, knowing the local prevalence and the local screening test accuracy helps the clinician to perform preventive measures to limit the diffusion of COVID-19 in the CKD population.","['COVID-19', 'accuracy', 'chronic kidney disease', 'screening text']",Journal of clinical medicine,2021-04-04,"[{'lastname': 'Martino', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'UO Nephrology, Dialysis, and Transplantation, San Bortolo Hospital, 36100 Vicenza, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Amici', 'firstname': 'Gianpaolo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'UO Nephrology and Dialysis, San Daniele del Friuli and Tolmezzo Hospital, ASUFC, 33038 San Daniele del Friuli, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Grandesso', 'firstname': 'Stefano', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory Medicine, Dolo-Mirano District, AULSS 3 Serenissima, 30100 Venezia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferraro Mortellaro', 'firstname': 'Rosella', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'UO Nephrology and Dialysis, San Daniele del Friuli and Tolmezzo Hospital, ASUFC, 33038 San Daniele del Friuli, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Lo Cicero', 'firstname': 'Antonina', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'UO Nephrology and Dialysis, San Daniele del Friuli and Tolmezzo Hospital, ASUFC, 33038 San Daniele del Friuli, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Novara', 'firstname': 'Giacomo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Oncology, and Gastroenterology, Urology Clinic University of Padua, 35124 Padua, Italy.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/jcm10051139

21098848",Predialysis and Dialysis Therapies Differently Affect Nitric Oxide Synthetic Pathway in Red Blood Cells from Uremic Patients: Focus on Peritoneal Dialysis.,"Red blood cells (RBCs) have been found to synthesize and release both nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), contributing to systemic NO bioavailability. These RBC functions resulted impaired in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study aimed to evaluate whether predialysis (conservative therapy, CT) and dialysis (peritoneal dialysis, PD; hemodialysis, HD) therapies used during CKD progression may differently affect NO-synthetic pathway in RBCs. Our data demonstrated that compared to PD, although endothelial-NO-synthase activation was similarly increased, HD and CT were associated to cGMP RBCs accumulation, caused by reduced activity of cGMP membrane transporter (MRP4). In parallel, plasma cGMP levels were increased by both CT and HD and they significantly decreased after hemodialysis, suggesting that this might be caused by reduced cGMP renal clearance. As conceivable, compared to healthy subjects, plasma nitrite levels were significantly reduced by HD and CT but not in patients on PD. Additionally, the increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) values did not reach the significance exclusively in patients on PD. Therefore, our results show that PD might better preserve the synthetic NO-pathway in CKD-erythrocytes. Whether this translates into a reduced development of uremic vascular complications requires further investigation.","['MRP4', 'cGMP', 'cardiovascular disease', 'chronic kidney disease', 'erythrocytes', 'hemodialysis', 'nitric oxide', 'peritoneal dialysis']",International journal of molecular sciences,2021-04-04,"[{'lastname': 'Palmerini', 'firstname': 'Carola', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy.\nCenter for Advanced Studies and Technology-CAST (ex CeSI-MeT), G. d'Annunzio University Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Piscitani', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Nephrology and Dialysis Unit, SS.

23737482",COVID-19 pandemic era: is it time to promote home dialysis and peritoneal dialysis?,"The novel coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. Older individuals and patients with comorbid conditions such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and immunologic diseases are at higher risk of contracting this severe infection. In particular, patients with advanced CKD constitute a vulnerable population and a challenge in the prevention and control of the disease. Home-based renal replacement therapies offer an opportunity to manage patients remotely, thus reducing the likelihood of infection due to direct human interaction. Patients are seen less frequently, limiting the close interaction between patients and healthcare workers who may contract and spread the disease. However, while home dialysis is a reasonable choice at this time due to the advantage of isolation of patients, measures must be assured to implement the program. Despite its logistical benefits, outpatient haemodialysis also presents certain challenges during times of crises such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and potentially future ones.","['COVID-19', 'ESRD', 'haemodialysis', 'home dialysis', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Clinical kidney journal,2021-04-03,"[{'lastname': 'Cozzolino', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Renal Division, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Conte', 'firstname': 'Ferruccio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Renal Division, ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Zappulo', 'firstname': 'Fulvia', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Experimental Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine (DIMES), Nephrology, Dialysis and Renal Transplant Unit, S.

Erythropoietin resistance index (ERI) is a useful tool used to evaluate the response to ESAs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the causes of high ERI in children undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD).
Patients who had been on PD for at least 1 year were included in this retrospective study. Demographic characteristics, residual kidney function (RKF), adequacy of dialysis, peritoneal glucose exposure, the number and reason for hospitalization, and medications were recorded. Anemia and laboratory parameters that may affect anemia were noted by taking the average of laboratory values in the last follow-up year (time-averaged). The weekly ESA dose was proportioned to the annual average hemoglobin value and body weight to calculate the ERI in terms of U/kg/week/g/dL.
A total of 100 patients were included in the study. The mean ESA dose and ERI value were 119.8 ± 66.22 U/kg/week and 13.01 ± 7.52 U/kg/week/g/dL, respectively. It was determined that the patients <5 years of age have very high ERI value, and these patients need 2 times more ESA than those >10 years of age. Absence of RKF, large number of hospitalization, and ACEI use were also found to affect the ERI value negatively.
We demonstrate that the most important factor affecting ERI value is young age.

406,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,33783265,Validity and reliability of high-resolution ultrasound imaging for the assessment of regional body composition in stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.,"Accurate measurement of muscle mass is an important research and clinical tool. High-resolution ultrasound (US) has shown potential as a method to assess muscle and fat mass at specific anatomical sites. However, there is limited evidence for the reliability of US to measure muscle size in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Therefore, we examined the validity and reliability of an US method compared to a gold standard comparison for the assessment of a quadriceps muscle in this clinical population.
Twenty people receiving CAPD (mean age = 56.5 ± 16.7 years) at a single dialysis unit were assessed on two occasions, 7 days apart. Measures of the mid-thigh, such as vastus lateralis (VL) anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA), VL muscle thickness and subcutaneous fat thickness were compared for US reliability and validity compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures.
US had high validity against gold standard MRI measures, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) equating to VL ACSA of 0.95, VL thickness of 0.99 and fat thickness of 0.98. The US measurements also exhibited high intra-rater reliability (ICCs: VL thickness = 0.98, total muscle thickness = 0.97 and fat thickness = 0.99) in measuring body composition at the mid-VL site in the study population.
Valid assessment of regional body composition can be achieved via high-resolution US in patients receiving CAPD. The validity and reliability of the US in repeated measures (in comparison to the gold standard MRI) warrant further investigation in the wider chronic kidney disease population.","['Chronic kidney disease (CKD)', 'magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)', 'reliability', 'ultrasound (US)', 'validity']",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,2021-03-31,"[{'lastname': 'Geneen', 'firstname': 'Louise J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'Centre of Health, Activity and Rehabilitation Research, School of Health Sciences, 3122Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Kinsella', 'firstname': 'Jodie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, 105646University of North Staffordshire, Stoke-on-Trent, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Zanotto', 'firstname': 'Tobia', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Centre of Health, Activity and Rehabilitation Research, School of Health Sciences, 3122Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Naish', 'firstname': 'Patrick F', 'initials': 'PF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, 105646University of North Staffordshire, Stoke-on-Trent, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Mercer', 'firstname': 'Thomas H', 'initials': 'TH', 'affiliation': 'Centre of Health, Activity and Rehabilitation Research, School of Health Sciences, 3122Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh, UK.'}]",None,None,"US had high validity against gold standard MRI measures, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) equating to VL ACSA of 0.95, VL thickness of 0.99 and fat thickness of 0.98.

19854839",Anemia management for home dialysis including the new US public policy initiative.,"Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring kidney replacement therapy are often treated in conventional dialysis centers at substantial cost and patient inconvenience. The recent United States Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health, in addition to focusing on ESKD prevention and reforming the kidney transplantation system, focuses on providing financial incentives to promote a shift toward home dialysis. In accordance with this order, a goal was set to have 80% of incident dialysis patients receiving home dialysis or a kidney transplant by 2025. Compared with conventional in-center therapy, home dialysis modalities, including both home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, appear to offer equivalent or improved mortality, clinical outcomes, hospitalization rates, and quality of life in patients with ESKD in addition to greater convenience, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. Treatment of anemia, a common complication of chronic kidney disease, may be easier to manage at home with a new class of agents, hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors, which are orally administered in contrast to the current standard of care of i.v. iron and/or erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. This review evaluates the clinical, quality-of-life, economic, and social aspects of dialysis modalities in patients with ESKD, including during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic; explores new therapeutics for the management of anemia in chronic kidney disease; and highlights how the proposed changes in Advancing American Kidney Health provide an opportunity to improve kidney health in the United States.","['end-stage kidney disease', 'hemodialysis', 'hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors', 'peritoneal dialysis']",Kidney international supplements,2021-03-30,"[{'lastname': 'Rastogi', 'firstname': 'Anjay', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, California, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lerma', 'firstname': 'Edgar V', 'initials': 'EV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of Illinois at Chicago/Advocate Christ Medical Center, Section of Nephrology, Oak Lawn, Illinois, USA.'}]",None,None,None,© 2021 International Society of Nephrology.

32513665","The COVID-19 Epidemic: Management and Outcomes of Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis Patients in Stockholm, Sweden.","The COVID-19 outbreak has been associated with a high morbidity, mortality, and a risk of long-term sequelae, and patients with severe COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute kidney injury. CKD patients are at high risk of being exposed to COVID-19 and suffer complications and poor outcome. In Sweden, mitigation strategies did not include lockdown. During March-April of 2020, wide-spread infection occurred in Stockholm.
Management and outcomes in forty hemodialysis (HD) patients and 4 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, with symptomatic COVID-19 in greater Stockholm during March and April of 2020 are reported.
Twenty-four HD patients (60%) required medical care and hospitalization, whereas 16 patients (40%) were treated at home. Nine patients died (mortality rate of 22.5%), of whom 8 were men. The median age in non-survivors (78 years) was significantly higher than in survivors (p = 0.003). The median time in dialysis (11.5 years) was also significantly longer in non-survivors (p = 0.01). C-reactive protein (CRP) at diagnosis in 7 of non-survivors (median 213 mg/L, range 86-329 mg/L) was significantly higher than the CRP in 25 survivors (median 87 mg/L, range 1-328 mg/L) (p = 0.0003). Maximum CRP also indicated poorer outcome among hospitalized patients (p = 0.0004). The gender imbalance was striking with only men dying apart from 1 elderly woman. Only 4 PD patients were hospitalized with symptomatic COVID-19. One patient died, 2 were discharged, and 1 was treated at the intensive care unit and survived.
HD patients >70 years were reported with longer dialysis vintage, higher CRP, and males were at an increased risk of dying from COVID-19, whereas those <70 years seemed to have a milder disease. Mitigation strategies to reduce rates of infection in high-risk populations remain essential. Follow-up focusing on long-term prognosis for extrapulmonary manifestations is likely to be important also in dialysis patients.","['COVID-19', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis', 'Management', 'Outcome']",Kidney & blood pressure research,2021-03-29,"[{'lastname': 'Smolander', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Renal Medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Bruchfeld', 'firstname': 'Annette', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health, Medicine and Caring Sciences, Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden.\nDepartment of Renal Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital and CLINTEC KI, Stockholm, Sweden.'}]",None,"HD patients >70 years were reported with longer dialysis vintage, higher CRP, and males were at an increased risk of dying from COVID-19, whereas those <70 years seemed to have a milder disease.

We report the trial design, key demographic, clinical and laboratory findings, and baseline therapies of 2964 patients randomized in the open-label (sponsor-blinded) active-controlled, parallel-group, randomized ASCEND-D clinical trial. We also compare baseline characteristics of ASCEND-D patients with patients who are on dialysis (CKD G5D) enrolled in other large CV outcome trials (CVOTs) and in the most relevant registries.
The median age of patients was 58 years, 43% were female; 67% were White and 16% were Black. The median Hb at baseline was 10.4 g/dL. Among randomized patients, 89% were receiving hemodialysis and 11% peritoneal dialysis. Among key comorbidities, 42% reported a history of diabetes mellitus and 45% a history of CV disease. Median blood pressure was 134/74 mmHg. The median weekly dose of epoetin was 5751 units. Intravenous and oral iron uses were noted in 64 and 11% of patients, respectively. Baseline demographics were similar to patients with CKD G5D enrolled in other CVOTs and renal patient registries.
ASCEND-D will evaluate the efficacy and safety of daprodustat compared with epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa in the treatment of patients with anemia with CKD G5D.This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02879305.

11900261",Home-based exercise and bone mineral density in peritoneal dialysis patients: a randomized pilot study.,"The prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis is higher in patients with chronic kidney disease than that in the general population. Although physical exercise prevents bone loss in hemodialysis (HD) patients, previous studies have not focused on peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effects of home-based exercise on bone mineral density (BMD) in patients with PD.
Stable outpatients undergoing PD were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 26; male, 20; median age, 66 years) or usual-care group (n = 27; male, 21; median age, 64 years). Patients in the intervention group performed home-based exercises (resistance exercise, stretching, and aerobic exercise such as walking) for 6 months, whereas those in the usual-care group performed stretching and their usual physical activity. Based on dual X-ray absorptiometry, the primary outcomes were the BMD data of the lumbar spine and proximal femoral neck. Secondary outcomes included physical function and physical activity. Pre- and post-intervention values were compared.
There was no significant within-group change in the BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and hip after 6 months of the exercise program. The intervention group had significantly improved 30-s chair-stand test, 6-min walk test, and physical activity results.
Home-based exercises in patients with PD did not improve BMD at any of the sites evaluated. Improvement in physical function and physical activity may reduce the risk of falls in patients with PD.

411,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,33734473,Chronic Kidney Disease and Nutrition Support.,"Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those undergoing maintenance dialysis, are prone to protein-energy wasting (PEW), the latter of which can be ameliorated with different methods of nutrition support. Dietary counseling guided by dietitians is the key for preventing and managing PEW in CKD. If dietary counseling per se fails to meet the recommended energy and protein requirements, the addition of oral nutrition supplements (ONSs) would be necessary. When these initial measures cannot attain the recommended energy and protein requirements, nutrition support, including enteral tube feeding or parenteral nutrition (PN), should be considered as a viable option to improve nutrition status. Partial PN, comprising intraperitoneal PN (IPPN) and intradialytic PN (IDPN) therapies, may be attempted as supplemental nutrition support in patients with PEW requiring peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, respectively. Despite the debatable effectiveness of IPPN for patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, it remains a feasible means in these patients. The indications for IPPN in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis include inadequate dietary intake of energy and protein, and barriers of oral intake and other forms of enteral supplementation such as issues with suitability, tolerance, and compliance. Nonetheless, in the case of spontaneous dietary consumption of energy and protein meeting the difference between the IDPN provision and the nutrition targets, the use of IDPN is rational. In patients with PEW and malfunctioning gastrointestinal tract, as well as those whose enteral intake (with or without partial PN) is below the recommended nutrient requirements, total PN becomes a relevant nutrition intervention.","['chronic kidney disease', 'energy', 'enteral nutrition', 'nutrition requirements', 'nutrition support', 'parenteral nutrition', 'protein']",Nutrition in clinical practice : official publication of the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition,2021-03-19,"[{'lastname': 'Chan', 'firstname': 'Winnie', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences, The University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.\nDepartment of Nephrology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Mindelsohn Way, Edgbaston, Birmingham, United Kingdom.'}]",None,None,None,© 2021 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.,10.1002/ncp.10658,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x17fb958a0>,chronic-kidney-disease,Peritoneal Dialysis,33734473,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33734473,9.0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan
412,chronic-kidney-disease|Peritoneal Dialysis,33725694,Whole-Exome Sequencing Solved over 2-Decade Kidney Disease Enigma.,"Chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology (CKDu) has been a problem in renal practice as indefinite diagnosis may lead to inappropriate management. Here, we report a 54-year-old father diagnosed with CKDu at 33 years old and his 8-year-old son with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Using whole-exome sequencing, both were found to be heterozygous for c.737G>A (p.Arg246Gln) in LMX1B. The diagnosis of LMX1B-associated nephropathy has led to changes in the treatment plan with appropriate genetic counseling. The previously reported cases with this particular mutation were also reviewed. Most children with LMX1B-associated nephropathy had nonnephrotic proteinuria with normal renal function. Interestingly, our pediatric case presented with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome at 8 years old and progressed to ESRD requiring peritoneal dialysis at the age of 15 years. Our report emphasized the need of genetic testing in CKDu for definite diagnosis leading to precise management.","['Genetic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis', 'LMX1B-associated nephropathy', 'Whole-exome sequencing']",Nephron,2021-03-17,"[{'lastname': 'Isaranuwatchai', 'firstname': 'Suramath', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Chanakul', 'firstname': 'Ankanee', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Ittiwut', 'firstname': 'Chupong', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Center of Excellence for Medical Genomics, Medical Genomics Cluster, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\nExcellence Center for Genomics and Precision Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, the Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Srichomthong', 'firstname': 'Chalurmpon', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Center of Excellence for Medical Genomics, Medical Genomics Cluster, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\nExcellence Center for Genomics and Precision Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, the Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Shotelersuk', 'firstname': 'Vorasuk', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Center of Excellence for Medical Genomics, Medical Genomics Cluster, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\nExcellence Center for Genomics and Precision Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, the Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Praditpornsilpa', 'firstname': 'Kearkiat', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand, kearkiat@hotmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Suphapeetiporn', 'firstname': 'Kanya', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Center of Excellence for Medical Genomics, Medical Genomics Cluster, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\nExcellence Center for Genomics and Precision Medicine, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, the Thai Red Cross Society, Bangkok, Thailand.'}]",None,None,None,"© 2021 S.

25417235",Hemodialysis vs Peritoneal Dialysis: Comparison of Net Survival in Incident Patients on Chronic Dialysis in Colombia.,"In the area of nephrology, the practical application of relative survival methodologies can provide information regarding the impact of outcomes for patients with kidney failure on dialysis compared with what would be expected in the absence of this condition.
Compare the net survival of hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in a cohort of incident patients on chronic dialysis in Colombia, according to the dialysis therapy modality.
Observational, analytic, historical cohort.
Renal Therapy Services (RTS) clinic network across Colombia.
Patients over 18 years old with chronic kidney disease, incidents in dialytic therapy, which reached day 90 of therapy. Recruitment took place from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2013, with a follow-up until December 31, 2018. The final cohort for analysis corresponds to a total of 12 508 patients, of which 5330 patients (42.6%) began HD and 7178 patients (57.4%) began PD.
Demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical variables were measured.
Analyses were conducted according to the treatment assigned (PD or HD) at the time of the inception of the cohort and another approach of analysis was done with a subsample of those patients who never changed the initial modality. To calculate expected survival, life tables were constructed for Colombia for the years 2006 to 2018. Net survival estimates were made using the Pohar Perme estimator. The comparison of the net survival curves was done using the method developed by Pavlič and Perme, the log-rank type.
Net survival at 5 years compared with the general population was estimated at 0.53 (95% confidence interval 0.52-0.54) in the dialysis cohort. In intention-to-treat analyses of 7178 patients on PD and 5330 patients on HD, by global and Pohar-Perme methods, survival (expressed as a ratio of survival in patients on dialysis to survival in an age-, sex- and geographic-matched general Colombian population) was higher in patients on HD than in those on PD. In year 1, net survival by Pavlov-Perme on PD was 0.79 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.78 - 0.80) and on HD 0.85 (95% CI 0.84 - 0.86); in year 5, 0.36 (95% CI 0.34 - 0.38) and 0.57 (95% CI 0.55 - 0.59) for PD and HD respectively.
There may be imbalances among the populations analyzed (HD vs PD), in which one or more variables other than the type of therapy may influence the survival of the patients. In Colombia there are marginal levels of underreporting of demographic data in some subpopulations that may affect life-tables construction.
An important difference was observed in terms of survival between the dialysis population and the population of reference without dialysis. Statistically significant differences were found in net survival between HD and PD, net survival was higher in patients on HD than in those on PD.
En néphrologie, l’application pratique des méthodologies de survie relative peut fournir des renseignements sur l’impact des résultats des patients atteints d’insuffisance rénale suivant des traitements de dialyse comparativement à ce qui serait attendu en l’absence de cette affection.
Comparer la survie nette, selon la modalité de dialyse, dans une cohorte de patients colombiens traités par hémodialyse (HD) ou par dialyse péritonéale (DP) de façon chronique.
Étude de cohorte observationnelle, analytique et historique.
Le réseau Renal Therapy Services (RTS) de la Colombie.
Des patients adultes souffrant d’insuffisance chronique ayant nouvellement débuté la dialyse depuis plus de 90 jours. Le recrutement a eu lieu du 1er janvier 2008 au 31 décembre 2013, et le suivi s’est poursuivi jusqu’au 31 décembre 2018. L’analyse porte sur un total de 12 508 patients, dont 5 330 (42,6 %) avaient entrepris des traitements d’hémodialyse et 7 178 (57,4 %) de dialyse péritonéale.
Les données démographiques, socio-économiques et cliniques des patients.
Les analyses ont été menées en fonction du traitement attribué (DP ou HD) au moment de la création de la cohorte. Une autre analyse a été réalisée sur un sous-échantillon de patients n’ayant jamais changé la modalité depuis le début du traitement. Des tables de survie spécifiques à la Colombie entre les années 2006 et 2018 ont été élaborées pour calculer la survie attendue. Les estimations de survie nette ont été faites en utilisant l’estimateur de Pohar Perme. Et la méthode développée par Pavlič et Perme, soit le test du log-rank a servi à la comparaison des courbes de survie nette.
La survie nette après cinq ans, comparée à celle de la population générale, a été estimée à 0,53 (IC 95 %: 0,52 à 0,54) dans la cohorte de patients dialysés. Dans les analyses en intention de traiter portant sur 7 178 patients sous HD et 5 330 patients sous DP — réalisées par méthode globale et avec l’estimateur Pohar Perme — la survie (exprimée sous forme de rapport entre la survie de patients dialysés et la survie de Colombiens de la population générale du même âge, sexe et région géographique) s’est avérée plus élevée chez les patients sous HD que chez les patients sous DP. Au cours de la première année, la survie nette (Pavlov Perme) des patients sous DP s’établissait à 0,79 (IC 95 % : 0,78-0,80) et celle des patients sous HD à 0,85 (IC 95 % : 0,84-0,86); après cinq ans, elle était passée à 0,36 (IC 95 % : 0,34-0,38) pour les patients sous DP et à 0,57 (IC 95 % : 0,55-0,59) pour les patients sous HD.
Il pourrait exister des disparités parmi les populations analysées (HD vs DP), où des variables autres que la modalité pourraient influencer la survie des patients. Il existe, dans certaines sous-populations de Colombie, des niveaux marginaux de sous-déclaration des données démographiques qui pourraient affecter l’élaboration des tables de survie.
Une différence importante a été observée entre la survie des patients dialysés et celle d’une population de référence (personnes non dialysées). On a également constaté des différences statistiquement significatives entre le groupe sous HD et le groupe sous DP en ce qui concerne la survie nette, laquelle s’est avérée plus élevée chez les patients sous HD.","['chronic kidney disease', 'hemodialysis', 'net survival', 'peritoneal dialysis', 'survival analysis']",Canadian journal of kidney health and disease,2021-03-16,"[{'lastname': 'Herrera', 'firstname': 'Lina', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gil', 'firstname': 'Fabián', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Bogota, Colombia.'}, {'lastname': 'Sanabria', 'firstname': 'Mauricio', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Renal Therapy Services-Latin America, Bogotá, Colombia.'}]",None,"An important difference was observed in terms of survival between the dialysis population and the population of reference without dialysis.

31101184",Potential Effects of Immunosuppression on Oxidative Stress and Atherosclerosis in Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"Chronic kidney disease is a public health problem that, depending on the country, affects approximately 8-13% of the population, involving both males and females of all ages. Renal replacement therapy remains one of the most costly procedures. It is assumed that one of the factors influencing the course of chronic kidney disease might be oxidative stress. It is believed that the main mediators of oxidative stress are reactive oxygen species (ROS). Transiently increased concentrations of ROS play a significant role in maintaining an organism's homeostasis, as they are part of the redox-related signaling, and in the immune defense system, as they are produced in high amounts in inflammation. Systemic oxidative stress can significantly contribute to endothelial dysfunction along with exaggeration of atherosclerosis and development of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in patients with kidney disease. Moreover, the progression of chronic kidney disease is strictly associated with the atherosclerotic process. Transplantation is the optimal method for renal replacement therapy. It improves better quality of life and prolongs survival compared with hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis; however, even a successful transplantation does not correct the abnormalities found in chronic kidney disease. As transplantation reduces the concentration of uremic toxins, which are a factor of inflammation per se, both the procedure itself and the subsequent immunosuppressive treatment may be a factor that increases oxidative stress and hence vascular sclerosis and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In the current work, we review the effect of several risk factors in kidney transplant recipients as well as immunosuppressive therapy on oxidative stress.",[],Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,2021-03-11,"[{'lastname': 'Kwiatkowska', 'firstname': 'Marlena', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis & Internal Diseases, The Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Oldakowska-Jedynak', 'firstname': 'Urszula', 'initials': 'U', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis & Internal Diseases, The Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Wojtaszek', 'firstname': 'Ewa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis & Internal Diseases, The Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Glogowski', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis & Internal Diseases, The Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Malyszko', 'firstname': 'Jolanta', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nephrology, Dialysis & Internal Diseases, The Medical University of Warsaw, Poland.'}]",None,None,None,Copyright © 2021 Marlena Kwiatkowska et al.,"10.1155/2021/6660846

30030582",A call to optimize haemodialysis vascular access care in healthcare disrupted by COVID-19 pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruption to the delivery of both routine and urgent healthcare needs in many institutions across the globe. Vascular access (VA) for haemodalysis (HD) is considered the patient's lifeline and its maintenance is essential for the continuation of a life saving treatment. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the provision of VA for dialysis was already constrained. Throughout the pandemic, inevitably, many patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have not received timely intervention for VA care. This could have a detrimental impact on dialysis patient outcomes in the near future and needs to be addressed urgently. Many societies have issued prioritisation to allow rationing based on clinical risk, mainly according to estimated urgency and need for treatment. The recommendations recently proposed by the European and American Vascular Societies in the COVID-19 pandemic era regarding the triage of various vascular operations into urgent, emergent and elective are debatable. VA creation and interventions maintain the lifeline of complex HD patients, and the indication for surgery and other interventions warrants patient-specific clinical judgement and pathways. Keeping the use of central venous catheters at a minimum, with the goal of creating the right access, in the right patient, at the right time, and for the right reasons, is mandatory. These strategies may require local modifications. Risk assessments may need specific ""renal pathways"" to be developed rather than applying standard surgical risk stratification. In conclusion, in order to recover from the second wave of COVID-19 and prepare for further phases, the provision of the best dialysis access, including peritoneal dialysis, will require working closely with the multidisciplinary team involved in the assessment, creation, cannulation, surveillance, maintenance, and salvage of definitive access.","['Arteriovenous fistula', 'COVID-19', 'Chronic kidney disease', 'Haemodialysis', 'Vascular access']",Journal of nephrology,2021-03-09,"[{'lastname': 'Basile', 'firstname': 'Carlo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Miulli General Hospital, 70021, Acquaviva delle Fonti, Italy. basile.miulli@libero.it.\nAssociazione Nefrologica Gabriella Sebastio, Martina Franca, Italy. basile.miulli@libero.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Lomonte', 'firstname': 'Carlo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Miulli General Hospital, 70021, Acquaviva delle Fonti, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Combe', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Service de Néphrologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.\nUnité INSERM 1026 BioTis, Université de Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Covic', 'firstname': 'Adrian', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Nephrology Clinic, Dialysis and Renal Transplant Center - 'C.I.

9272792",The Prevalence and Severity of Chronic Pain in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Chronic pain is a common and distressing symptom reported by patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Clinical practice and research in this area do not appear to be advancing sufficiently to address the issue of chronic pain management in patients with CKD.
To determine the prevalence and severity of chronic pain in patients with CKD.
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Interventional and observational studies presenting data from 2000 or later. Exclusion criteria included acute kidney injury or studies that limited the study population to a specific cause, symptom, and/or comorbidity.
Adults with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) category 3 to 5 CKD including dialysis patients and those managed conservatively without dialysis.
Data extracted included title, first author, design, country, year of data collection, publication year, mean age, stage of CKD, prevalence of pain, and severity of pain.
Databases searched included MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library, last searched on February 3, 2020. Two reviewers independently screened all titles and abstracts, assessed potentially relevant articles, and extracted data. We estimated pooled prevalence of overall chronic pain, musculoskeletal pain, bone/joint pain, muscle pain/soreness, and neuropathic pain and the 
Sixty-eight studies representing 16 558 patients from 26 countries were included. The mean prevalence of chronic pain in hemodialysis patients was 60.5%, and the mean prevalence of moderate or severe pain was 43.6%. Although limited, pain prevalence data for peritoneal dialysis patients (35.9%), those managed conservatively without dialysis (59.8%), those following withdrawal of dialysis (39.2%), and patients with earlier GFR category of CKD (61.2%) suggest similarly high prevalence rates.
Studies lacked a consistent approach to defining the chronicity and nature of pain. There was also variability in the measures used to determine pain severity, limiting the ability to compare findings across populations. Furthermore, most studies reported mean severity scores for the entire cohort, rather than reporting the prevalence (numerator and denominator) for each of the pain severity categories (mild, moderate, and severe). Mean severity scores for a population do not allow for ""responder analyses"" nor allow for an understanding of clinically relevant pain.
Chronic pain is common and often severe across diverse CKD populations providing a strong imperative to establish chronic pain management as a clinical and research priority. Future research needs to move toward a better understanding of the determinants of chronic pain and to evaluating the effectiveness of pain management strategies with particular attention to the patient outcomes such as overall symptom burden, physical function, and quality of life. The current variability in the outcome measures used to assess pain limits the ability to pool data or make comparisons among studies, which will hinder future evaluations of the efficacy and effectiveness of treatments. Recommendations for measuring and reporting pain in future CKD studies are provided.

La douleur chronique est un symptôme affligeant fréquemment rapporté par les patients atteints d’insuffisance rénale chronique (IRC). Pourtant, la recherche et la pratique clinique dans ce domaine ne semblent pas progresser suffisamment pour aborder sa gestion dans cette population.
Déterminer la prévalence et l’intensité de la douleur chronique chez les patients atteints d’IRC.
Revue systématique et méta-analyse.
Les études observationnelles et interventionnelles présentant des données depuis l’an 2000. Ont été exclus les cas d’insuffisance rénale aigüe et les études portant sur une population ayant une cause, un symptôme ou une maladie concomitante en particulier.
Des adultes atteints d’IRC de stade 3 à 5, y compris des patients dialysés et des patients non dialysés pris en charge de façon conservatrice.
Les données extraites comprenaient le titre de l’article, le nom de l’auteur principal, le type d’étude, le pays où s’est tenue l’étude, l’année de collection des données, l’année de publication, l’âge médian des sujets, le stade de l’IRC, la prévalence de la douleur et son intensité.
Les données ont été colligées dans MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE et la bibliothèque Cochrane. La dernière consultation date du 3 février 2020. Deux examinateurs ont, de façon indépendante, trié les titres et les abrégés, évalué les articles potentiellement pertinents et extrait les données. La prévalence combinée de la douleur chronique globale, de la douleur musculo-squelettique, de la douleur osseuse/articulaire, de la douleur musculaire et de la douleur neuropathique a été évaluée, et le calcul de la statistique 
Soixante-huit études ont été incluses, lesquelles portaient sur un total de 16 558 patients dans 26 pays. La prévalence moyenne de la douleur chronique chez les patients hémodialysés était de 60,5 %; la prévalence moyenne de la douleur modérée ou sévère était de 43,6 %. Quoique limitées, les données portant sur des patients sous dialyse péritonéale (35,9 %), des patients suivant des traitements conservateurs sans dialyse (59,8 %), des patients ayant arrêté la dialyse (39,2 %) ou des patients atteints d’un stade inférieur d’IRC (61,2 %) suggèrent une prévalence tout aussi élevée.
Les études incluses manquaient de cohérence dans leur approche pour définir la chronicité et la nature de la douleur. Les mesures utilisées pour déterminer l’intensité de la douleur étaient variables, ce qui a limité la comparaison des résultats entre les populations. La plupart des études indiquaient des scores moyens d’intensité pour l’ensemble de la cohorte plutôt que la prévalence (numérateur et dénominateur) de chacune des catégories d’intensité (légère, modérée et sévère). Les scores moyens d’intensité pour une population ne permettent pas « les analyses de répondants » et la compréhension de la douleur cliniquement pertinente.
La douleur chronique est fréquente et souvent intense dans les diverses populations de patients atteints d’IRC, ce qui confirme la gestion de la douleur chronique comme priorité clinique et de recherche. Les recherches futures devraient permettre une meilleure compréhension des déterminants de la douleur chronique et évaluer l’efficacité des stratégies de gestion de la douleur en accordant une attention particulière aux résultats des patients, notamment au fardeau global des symptômes, à la fonction physique et à la qualité de vie. La capacité de regrouper des données ou de faire des comparaisons entre les études est limitée par la variabilité actuelle des mesures utilisées pour évaluer la douleur, ce qui entravera les futures évaluations de l’efficacité des traitements. Des recommandations pour mesurer et signaler la douleur dans les futures études sur l’IRC sont fournies.","['chronic kidney disease', 'chronic pain', 'meta-analysis', 'prevalence', 'systematic review']",Canadian journal of kidney health and disease,2021-03-09,"[{'lastname': 'Davison', 'firstname': 'Sara N', 'initials': 'SN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Rathwell', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Women & Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.""}, {'lastname': 'Ghosh', 'firstname': 'Sunita', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.\nAlberta Health Services-Cancer Care, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'George', 'firstname': 'Chelsy', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Kidney Supportive Care Research Group, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Pfister', 'firstname': 'Ted', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'IPC Surveillance and Standards, Infection Prevention and Control, Alberta Health Services, Calgary, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Dennett', 'firstname': 'Liz', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'John W.

29532981","Effect of Unripe Banana Flour on Gut-Derived Uremic Toxins in Individuals Undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Trial.","In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the accumulation of gut-derived metabolites, such as indoxyl sulfate (IS), p-cresyl sulfate (pCS), and indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), has been associated with the burden of the disease. In this context, prebiotics emerge as a strategy to mitigate the accumulation of such compounds, by modulating the gut microbiota and production of their metabolites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of unripe banana flour (UBF-48% resistant starch, a prebiotic) on serum concentrations of IS, pCS, and IAA in individuals undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial was conducted. Forty-three individuals on PD were randomized to sequential treatment with UBF (21 g/day) and placebo (waxy corn starch-12 g/day) for 4 weeks, or vice versa (4-week washout). The primary outcomes were total and free serum levels of IS, pCS, and IAA. Secondary outcomes were 24 h urine excretion and dialysis removal of IS, pCS, and IAA, serum inflammatory markers [high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)], serum lipopolysaccharide LPS, and dietary intake. Of the 43 individuals randomized, 26 completed the follow-up (age = 55 ± 12 years; 53.8% men). UBF did not promote changes in serum levels of IS (","['chronic kidney disease', 'gut', 'prebiotic', 'unripe banana flour', 'uremic toxins']",Nutrients,2021-03-07,"[{'lastname': 'de Andrade', 'firstname': 'Laila Santos', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Nutrition Program, Universidade Federal de São Paulo-UNIFESP, São Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Sardá', 'firstname': 'Fabiana Andréa Hoffmann', 'initials': 'FAH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Food and Experimental Nutrition, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universidade de São Paulo-USP, São Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.\nAPC Microbiome Ireland, University College Cork, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'Natalia Barros Ferreira', 'initials': 'NBF', 'affiliation': 'Nutrition Program, Universidade Federal de São Paulo-UNIFESP, São Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Teixeira', 'firstname': 'Renata Rodrigues', 'initials': 'RR', 'affiliation': 'Nutrition Program, Universidade Federal de São Paulo-UNIFESP, São Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodrigues', 'firstname': 'Silvia Daniéle', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Basic Pathology, Universidade Federal do Paraná-UFPR, Curitiba 81531-980, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'de Lima', 'firstname': 'Jordana Dinorá', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cell Biology, Universidade Federal do Paraná-UFPR, Curitiba 81531-980, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Dalboni', 'firstname': 'Maria Aparecida', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Post-Graduate Program in Medicine, Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE, São Paulo 01504-001, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Aoike', 'firstname': 'Danilo Takashi', 'initials': 'DT', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Universidade Federal de São Paulo-UNIFESP, Rua Botucatu, 720/740, São Paulo 04023-062, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakao', 'firstname': 'Lia Sumie', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Basic Pathology, Universidade Federal do Paraná-UFPR, Curitiba 81531-980, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Cuppari', 'firstname': 'Lilian', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Nutrition Program, Universidade Federal de São Paulo-UNIFESP, São Paulo 05508-000, Brazil.\nDivision of Nephrology, Universidade Federal de São Paulo-UNIFESP, Rua Botucatu, 720/740, São Paulo 04023-062, Brazil.\nDialysis Department, Hospital do Rim-Fundação Oswaldo Ramos, São Paulo 04038-002, Brazil.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/nu13020646

While definitive treatment is renal transplantation, many patients require kidney replacement therapy with haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). The predominant modality utilized in Kenya is currently HD. There is a need to explore why PD remains underutilized and whether patient factors may be contributory to barriers that limit the uptake of PD.
This was a descriptive cross-sectional study where patients with advanced CKD were assessed by a multidisciplinary team for PD eligibility using a standardized tool. Contraindications and barriers to the modality were recorded as was the presence or absence of support for the provision of PD. Demographic and clinical data were recorded using a standardized questionnaire. The impact of support on PD eligibility was determined.
We found that 68.9% patients were eligible for PD. Surgery-related abdominal scarring was the most common contraindication. Barriers to PD were identified in 45.9% and physical barriers were more common than cognitive barriers. Presence of support was associated with a significant increase in PD eligibility (
The rate of eligibility for PD in this study was similar to that found in other populations. Surgical-related factors were the most commonly identified contraindication.

30298704",AGEs accumulation is related to muscle degeneration and vascular calcification in peritoneal dialysis patients.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are affected by dynapenia, sarcopenia, and vascular calcification. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) may accumulate in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and favor sarcopenia via changes in collagen cross-linking, muscle protein breakdown, and the calcification of arterial smooth muscle cells via p38-MAPK activation. The aim of this study is to explore the relationships between AGEs, muscle degeneration, and coronary artery calcification.
This was a clinical observational study in patients with CKD undergoing PD, in which serum and skin AGEs (AGEs-sAF), cumulative glucose load, muscle strength and functional tests, muscle ultrasounds with elastography, coronary artery calcium (CAC) quantification, and muscle density by multislice computed tomography were measured.
27 patients aged 48±16 years, dialysis vintage of 27±17 months, had AGEs-sAF levels of 3.09±0.65 AU (elevated in 13 [87%] patients), grip strength levels of 26.2±9.2 kg (11 [42%] patients with dynapenia), gait speed of 1.04±0.3 m/s (abnormal in 14 [58%] patients) and ""timed-up-and-go test"" (TUG) of 10.5±2.2s (abnormal in 7 [26%] patients). Correlations between AGEs-sAF levels and femoral rectus elastography (R=-0.74; p=0.02), anterior-tibialis elastography (R= -0.68; p=0.04) and CAC (R=0.64; p=0.04) were detected. Cumulative glucose load correlated with femoral rectal elastography (R=-0.6; p=0.02), and serum glycated hemoglobin concentrations correlated with psoas muscle density (R= -0.58; p=0.04) and CAC correlated with psoas muscle density (R=0.57; p=0.01) and lumbar square muscle density (R=-0.63; p=0.005).
The study revealed associations between AGEs accumulation and lower muscle stiffness/density. Associations that linked muscle degeneration parameters with vascular calcification were observed.
Pacientes com doença renal crônica (DRC) são afetados pela dinapenia, sarcopenia e calcificação vascular. Produtos finais da glicação avançada (AGEs) podem se acumular em pacientes em diálise peritoneal (DP) e favorecer a sarcopenia por meio de alterações em ligações cruzadas do colágeno, quebra da proteína muscular e calcificação das células do músculo liso arterial por meio da ativação da p38-MAPK. O objetivo deste estudo é explorar as relações entre AGEs, degeneração muscular e calcificação da artéria coronária.
Este foi um estudo clínico observacional em pacientes com DRC submetidos à DP, no qual foram medidos os AGEs séricos e teciduais (AGEs-sAF), a carga cumulativa de glicose, a força muscular e testes funcionais, ultrassonografias musculares com elastografia, quantificação do cálcio da artéria coronária (CAC), e a densidade muscular por tomografia computadorizada multislice.
27 pacientes com idade entre 48±16 anos, tempo de diálise entre 27±17 meses, tinham níveis de AGEs-sAF de 3,09±0,65 UA (elevado em 13 [87%] pacientes), níveis de força de preensão de 26,2±9,2 kg (11 [42%] pacientes com dinapenia), velocidade de marcha de 1,04±0,3 m/s (anormal em 14 [58%] pacientes) e teste ""timed-up-and-go"" (TUG) de 10,5±2,2s (anormal em 7 [26%] pacientes). Foram detectadas correlações entre os níveis AGEs-sAF e a elastografia do reto femoral (R=-0,74; p=0,02), a elastografia tibial anterior (R= -0,68; p=0,04) e a CAC (R=0,64; p=0,04). A carga cumulativa de glicose se correlacionou com a elastografia do reto femoral (R=-0,6; p=0,02), as concentrações séricas de hemoglobina glicada se correlacionaram com a densidade muscular do psoas (R= -0,58; p=0,04) e o CAC se correlacionou com a densidade do músculo psoas (R=-0,57; p=0,01) e a densidade do músculo quadrado lombar (R=-0,63; p=0,005).
O estudo revelou associações entre o acúmulo de AGEs e menor rigidez/densidade muscular. Foram observadas associações que ligavam parâmetros de degeneração muscular com a calcificação vascular.",[],Jornal brasileiro de nefrologia,2021-03-03,"[{'lastname': 'Fonseca', 'firstname': 'Laís de Faria', 'initials': 'LF', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Laboratório para o Estudo do Distúrbio Mineral e Ósseo em Nefrologia, Campinas, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Araújo', 'firstname': 'Anna Beatriz', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Departamento de Clínica Médica, Campinas, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Quadros', 'firstname': 'Kélcia Rosana da Silva', 'initials': 'KRDS', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Laboratório para o Estudo do Distúrbio Mineral e Ósseo em Nefrologia, Campinas, SP, Brasil.\nUniversidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Departamento de Clínica Médica, Campinas, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Carbonara', 'firstname': 'Cinthia Esbrile Moraes', 'initials': 'CEM', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Laboratório para o Estudo do Distúrbio Mineral e Ósseo em Nefrologia, Campinas, SP, Brasil.\nUniversidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Departamento de Clínica Médica, Campinas, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Dertkigil', 'firstname': 'Sérgio San Juan', 'initials': 'SSJ', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Departamento de Radiologia, Campinas, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Sposito', 'firstname': 'Andrei Carvalho', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Departamento de Clínica Médica, Campinas, SP, Brasil.'}, {'lastname': 'Oliveira', 'firstname': 'Rodrigo Bueno de', 'initials': 'RB', 'affiliation': 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Laboratório para o Estudo do Distúrbio Mineral e Ósseo em Nefrologia, Campinas, SP, Brasil.\nUniversidade Estadual de Campinas, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Departamento de Clínica Médica, Campinas, SP, Brasil.'}]",None,None,"27 patients aged 48±16 years, dialysis vintage of 27±17 months, had AGEs-sAF levels of 3.09±0.65 AU (elevated in 13 [87%] patients), grip strength levels of 26.2±9.2 kg (11 [42%] patients with dynapenia), gait speed of 1.04±0.3 m/s (abnormal in 14 [58%] patients) and ""timed-up-and-go test"" (TUG) of 10.5±2.2s (abnormal in 7 [26%] patients).
