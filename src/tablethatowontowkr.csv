0,panic-disorder|DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,22632477,Distinct panicogenic activity of sodium lactate and cholecystokinin tetrapeptide in patients with panic disorder.,"The validity of experimentally induced panic attacks as a model to study the pathophysiology of panic disorder has been questioned. Unspecific, unpleasant and aversive effects as well as specific patterns of psychovegetative symptoms pointing to different subtypes of panic disorder patients have been observed. These findings raise the question of challenge paradigms as a valuable tool to identify different vulnerabilities in patients with panic disorder.
We compared the two most widely studied panicogenic drugs sodium lactate and cholecystokinine tetrapeptide (CCK-4) with placebo in 25 patients with panic disorder and matched healthy control subjects. Psychophysiological changes were measured using the Acute Panic Inventory (API) and visual analogue scales for anxiety and arousal.
In patients with panic disorder 18 out of 25 experienced a sodium lactate- or a CCK-4 induced panic attack. Lactate or CCK-4 induced symptoms and induced panic attacks were only correlated in healthy controls, but not in patients with panic disorder.
The mechanisms of lactate and CCK-4 induced panic attacks are distinct in panic disorder patients but not in healthy controls.

11153547",Experimental induction of panic-like symptoms in patients with postural tachycardia syndrome.,"Patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) might be misdiagnosed with panic disorder due to shared clinical features. The first aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between symptoms of POTS and panic disorder. The second aim was to delineate clinical features distinguishing symptoms of POTS from panic disorder. A total of 11 patients with POTS and 11 control subjects participated in an IRB-approved, prospective, placebo-controlled study. The experimentally induced panic-like symptoms of POTS were systematically studied using the Acute Panic Inventory (API) questionnaire. The participants answered the questionnaire after each placebo infusion and after each of the three provoking stimuli: head-up tilt test (HUT), isoproterenol infusion (ISI), and sodium lactate infusion (SLI). API responses were summed for each subject at each time point of administration. Individual API symptoms and summed responses were analyzed for statistical significance. All patients with POTS developed symptoms of orthostatic intolerance during HUT. Pharmacologically induced symptoms subjectively mimicked spontaneous symptoms in 5 of 11 patients during ISI and in none of 11 patients during SLI. In contrast, API scores in these patients reached panic threshold in 0 of 11 following HUT, in 4 of 11 following ISI and in 4 of 11 following SLI. Individual symptoms analysis revealed that significant increase in scores was limited to the somatic symptoms of palpitations, dyspnea, and twitching or trembling. In conclusion, the symptoms of POTS are phenomenologically different and clinically distinguishable from panic disorder symptoms.",[],Clinical autonomic research : official journal of the Clinical Autonomic Research Society,2006-08-18,"[{'lastname': 'Khurana', 'firstname': 'Ramesh K', 'initials': 'RK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Neurology, The Union Memorial Hospital, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA. ramesh.khurana@medstar.net'}]",None,None,None,None,10.1007/s10286-006-0365-0,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x15fc9f6a0>,panic-disorder,DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,16915526,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16915526,29
2,panic-disorder|DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,15935432,The influence of ethanol infusion on the effects of 35% CO2 challenge. A study in panic disorder patients and healthy volunteers.,"Alcohol and panic disorders co-occur at a rate that exceeds chance significantly. Early experimental work suggests that alcoholic subjects, compared to non-alcoholics, are less sensitive to sodium lactate and that alcohol intake reduces the response to a 35% CO(2) challenge in Panic Disorder patients. The present study documents the direct pharmacological effect of ethanol infusion on CO(2) induced panic.
According to a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over design 10 drug free panic disorder patients and 16 healthy volunteers underwent a 35% CO(2) challenge after intravenous infusion of a moderate dose of ethanol on one test day and of placebo on another test day.
Compared to the placebo condition, the effect of the CO(2) challenge was significantly smaller after ethanol infusion (P = 0.041).

3,panic-disorder|DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,12894612,"Correlates of therapeutic response in panic disorder presenting with palpitations: heart rate variability, sleep, and placebo effect.","To examine the correlates of therapeutic response of patients with panic disorder presenting with palpitations, we hypothesized that therapeutic response would correlate with heart rate variability (HRV) and sleep measures.
After a 1-week placebo washout, 27 patients free of structural heart disease and not on cardioactive drugs were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to 4 weeks of treatment with clonazepam (a known antipanic agent) or placebo. We performed standard sleep measures and recorded HRV from 24-hour Holter acquisitions at baseline and end of study. We defined response to therapy as a 50% improvement in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) score, confirmed by questionnaires and reaction to sodium lactate infusion.
There were 12 responders and 15 nonresponders. Normalization of sleep pattern (including less stage 1 and rapid eye movement [REM] sleep) was observed in both drug and placebo responders (P = 0.011 and P = 0.05, respectively) and in placebo responders alone, compared with nonresponders (P = 0.006 and P = 0.013, respectively). Placebo responders were more likely to show less depression, but even after we controlled for depression, main sleep effects remained. None of the HRV measures correlated with response, but compared with placebo, clonazepam led to a decrease in all the time and frequency domain measures of HRV (all P < 0.05).
Central mechanisms are related to the therapeutic response of patients with panic disorder presenting with palpitations, but this does not directly correlate with HRV.

MRSI was used to serially measure regional brain lactate levels from an axial section at the level of the lateral ventricles at baseline, during lactate infusion and postlactate infusion. Gabapentin treatment appeared to be effective in blocking a lactate-induced panic response but did not alter the magnitude or time course of an abnormal brain lactate response to lactate infusion in all subjects.

It has been suggested that gender-related differences may be relevant in the development and maintenance of panic disorder. In a randomized double blind design the effects of placebo and sodium lactate administration in 14 female and 16 male patients with panic disorder and 23 healthy control subjects were compared using the Acute Panic Inventory (API) score and derived formal criteria for a panic attack. Panic attack frequency following sodium lactate was 76.6% in the patient group. Although control subjects had a lactate-induced increase in the API score as well, this effect was much weaker. No panic attacks occurred in patients with panic disorder or healthy control subjects receiving a placebo. However, a gender effect was observed in the putative panicogenic placebo condition: female patients with panic disorder had more subthreshold panic anxiety as measured with the API score.

We compared in panic disorder and healthy subjects behavioral, electrolyte, endocrine, and acid-base responses to three double-blind randomly ordered equal volume 20-min infusions: 0.5 mol/L sodium lactate, hypertonic saline (3% sodium chloride), and normal saline placebo.
Sodium lactate (0.5 mol/L) and hypertonic saline produced the same high incidence of panic and equivalent increases in panic symptoms, serum sodium, and plasma vasopressin in the panic disorder subjects.

9,panic-disorder|DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,9693999,Atrial natriuretic hormone in lactate-induced panic attacks: mode of release and endocrine and pathophysiological consequences.,"Previous studies have shown unequivocally a lack of pituitary-adrenocortical stress hormone activation during lactate-induced panic attacks despite considerable psychopathological alterations, signs of arousal and several vegetative symptoms regularly occurring during stressful conditions. To study the possible inhibitory action of atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) on adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol release in humans, 10 patients with panic disorder (DSM-III-R) received sodium lactate and placebo (0.9% saline) infusions and ten healthy comparison subjects additionally received a 2.5% saline infusion and the response of ANH, vasopressin, ACTH, cortisol, and several biochemical and physiological cardiovascular parameters were measured. In comparison to placebo, lactate infusion led to enhanced ANH levels in both non-panicking comparison subjects and panickers. Importantly, panickers showed significantly lower baseline levels of ANH than comparison subjects followed by a faster release. No significant concomitant changes in vasopressin, ACTH, and cortisol were observed. During lactate infusion, heart rate was accelerated considerably in the two groups; in contrast, the reduction of pCO2 indicated an enhanced ventilation only in panickers. The pattern of ANH release cannot be attributed simply to either the volume load administered, the cardiac activation or an osmotic effect since neither 0.9 nor 2.5% saline resulted in comparable effects. Additional central nervous mechanisms must be considered for the increased ANH concentrations in lactate-induced panic attacks. We propose that the release of ANH is an intrinsic mechanism contributing to the apparent unresponsiveness of the pituitary-adrenocortical system in lactate-induced panic attacks. In addition, we surmise that ANH may also play a role in the yet unknown mechanisms for termination of panic attacks, e.g. either by inhibitory actions on the locus coeruleus or by bronchiorelaxation and consecutive decatastrophization.",[],Journal of psychiatric research,1998-08-07,"[{'lastname': 'Kellner', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Knaudt', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Jahn', 'firstname': 'H', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Holsboer', 'firstname': 'F', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Wiedemann', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,10.1016/s0022-3956(97)00034-4,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x1696f6160>,panic-disorder,DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,9693999,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9693999,28

Controlling for baseline symptom levels, the most robust partial correlations of symptomatic increment with panic were Desire to flee (0.70), Fear of losing control (0.57), Afraid in general (0.49), and Dyspnea (0.48). Using a dichotomized symptom increment greater than 1, 13 of 29 API items indicated a panic response to lactate infusion; the best were Dyspnea, Feeling confused, Afraid in general, Difficulty speaking, Difficulty concentrating, Desire to flee, and Fear of losing control. A logistic regression analysis showed that among baseline measures, Afraid in general and Feeling confused significantly predicted panic. For dichotomized change scores, Afraid in general, Dyspnea, and Dizziness/lightheadedness significantly indicated panic. In these analyses three symptom items stand out as the most predictive and revealing of panic to lactate infusion: Afraid in general, Dyspnea, and Desire to flee.

14,panic-disorder|DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,8570764,Effects of intravenous diazepam pretreatment on lactate-induced panic.,"The psychological and physiological effects of acute low-potency benzodiazepine administration on lactate-induced panic were examined in 10 patients with panic disorder (PD). The patients, who had panicked during a standard sodium-lactate infusion, underwent a repeat infusion modified by pretreatment with intravenous diazepam (5 mg). Acute Panic Inventory (API) scores preceding the second lactate infusion, which were associated with diazepam pretreatment, were significantly reduced in compared with those measured before the first lactate infusion. However, the second visit ""fear of doom"" item of the API was significantly reduced relative to the same time point of the first visit 35 min before lactate infusion, when diazepam had not yet been administered. Thus, the reduction of prelactate anxiety preceding the second infusion appeared to reflect both pharmacological and nonpharmacological contributions. The diazepam pretreatment condition was associated with a significantly increased infusion duration and a significant attenuation of rate of API symptom increase in response to lactate. Despite significant attenuation of lactate infusion effects associated with the diazepam pretreatment condition, 7 of 10 patients experienced a second panic attack. This pilot study suggests that diazepam pretreatment is associated with a marked reduction of symptomatic response during a second lactate infusion, although the magnitude of attenuation observed was insufficient to block lactate-induced panic in a majority of lactate-vulnerable PD patients.",[],Psychiatry research,1995-09-29,"[{'lastname': 'Liebowitz', 'firstname': 'M R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': 'New York State Psychiatric Institute, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Coplan', 'firstname': 'J D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Martinez', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fyer', 'firstname': 'A J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Dillon', 'firstname': 'D J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Campeas', 'firstname': 'R B', 'initials': 'RB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Davies', 'firstname': 'S O', 'initials': 'SO', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gorman', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'D F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,10.1016/0165-1781(95)02530-a,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x15febc5e0>,panic-disorder,DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,8570764,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8570764,7

Thirteen of 22 subjects panicked in response to lactate and nine of 20 subjects panicked in response to bicarbonate. Although the rate of panic between the two infusion responses was not significantly different, several aspects of response to the two infusions indicated that lactate may be a more potent producer of anxiety than bicarbonate.

The time course of changes in the dependent variables was closely monitored, and expectancy biases and demand characteristics were minimized. Lactate increased self-reported anxiety and heart rate equally in patients and controls. The only variables showing statistically different responses between the groups were systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Overall, in both groups, the effects of lactate were quite similar to states of natural panic or anxiety for both self-report measures and heart rate. Patients had a tendency to endorse somatic symptoms indiscriminately.

30,panic-disorder|DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,3609849,Vasopressin response to lactate infusion in normals and patients with panic disorder.,"Infusions of sodium lactate evoke panic symptoms in patients with panic disorder but not in normal subjects. Although plasma vasopressin (AVP) is known to rise in response to other forms of stress, its response during this maneuver has not previously been reported. We measured plasma AVP in double-blind infusions of sodium lactate in 5 normal subjects, 6 patients with panic disorder, and, again in 4 patients after chronic alprazolam. In all groups administered lactate, AVP rose significantly above baseline values (p less than 0.05) though no change was seen in a control group of patients during D5NS infusion. No difference in AVP response to lactate was apparent between untreated patients (who experienced panic) and normals or chronically treated patients (who had minimal symptoms). Thus, the presence of panic symptoms induced by lactate is insufficient to provoke an abnormal pattern of AVP release.",[],Functional neurology,1986-04-01,"[{'lastname': 'Carr', 'firstname': 'D B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fishman', 'firstname': 'S M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Kasting', 'firstname': 'N W', 'initials': 'NW', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sheehan', 'firstname': 'D V', 'initials': 'DV', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,None,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x16955e610>,panic-disorder,DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,3609849,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3609849,0
31,panic-disorder|DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,2869059,Alprazolam in the treatment of panic disorders.,"An open clinical trial of alprazolam therapy of patients with panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks was undertaken to clarify certain issues not resolved by previous studies. These included the proportion of patients who significantly improve with alprazolam; the relative time courses for improvement in panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, and phobic avoidance; whether successful alprazolam treatment alters vulnerability to panic with sodium lactate infusion; and what factors predict response to alprazolam in panic patients. Thirty patients meeting DSM-III criteria for panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks completed a 12-week open clinical trial, and 22 were considered responders. In responders, panic attacks showed rapid improvement, whereas improvement of anticipatory anxiety and phobic avoidance was more variable. Successful alprazolam therapy appeared to block lactate vulnerability. High pretreatment Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores were associated with poor treatment response. The data suggest that alprazolam is an effective treatment for panic disorder and agoraphobia with panic attacks, and acts by directly blocking panic attacks.",[],Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,1986-02-01,"[{'lastname': 'Liebowitz', 'firstname': 'M R', 'initials': 'MR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Fyer', 'firstname': 'A J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Gorman', 'firstname': 'J M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Campeas', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Levin', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Davies', 'firstname': 'S R', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Goetz', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'D F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,None,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x169534db0>,panic-disorder,DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,2869059,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2869059,0
32,panic-disorder|DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,3574642,Effects of lactate-induced panic attacks on brain stem auditory evoked potentials.,"As the clinical symptomatology of panic attacks may be conceivably related to abnormal brain stem activity, the present study examined the effect of lactate-precipitated panic on brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BSAEPs). The subjects were 27 patients who met DSM-III criteria for panic disorder (Pd), agoraphobia with panic attacks (AgPa) or agoraphobia (Ag). Following drug washout, patients were tested in two separate sessions, in a double-blind randomised controlled design in which each session involved two sequentially ordered BSAEP collection periods - a baseline period with no infusion followed by an intravenous infusion of 5% dextrose in water or 1.0 M sodium lactate (5 ml/kg in 5% dextrose/water) over a 20-min period. Of the 27 patients, 17 were clear responders, reporting panic attacks and self-report changes under lactate similar to those occurring during spontaneous panic. Of the remaining 10 patients, 6 were pseudo-responders, reporting panic symptoms under both dextrose and lactate, and 4 were non-responders. In the clear responders, lactate did not alter electrical events of the BSAEP, but further analysis within the clear responders, comparing AgPa patients with Pd patients, yielded a significant effect with lactate resulting in a prolonged III-V inter-peak interval in the AgPa group. It is suggested that the increased III-V interval in the AgPa group may be reflective of hyperactivity of brain stem noradrenergic nuclei.",[],Neuropsychobiology,1986-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Knott', 'firstname': 'V J', 'initials': 'VJ', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Lapierre', 'firstname': 'Y D', 'initials': 'YD', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,10.1159/000118290,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x1695485e0>,panic-disorder,DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,3574642,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3574642,14
33,panic-disorder|DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,3887490,Panic disorder: response to sodium lactate and treatment with antidepressants.,"Effective drugs for mental disorders have been found by serendipitous findings not supported by knowledge of psychopharmacology. Drug are assigned labels, such as ""antidepressant"" without knowledge that such a label delimits the utility of such agents. Many double-blind controlled studies have shown that imipramine effectively ameliorates panic attacks and agoraphobia. Epidemiological data show a relationship between Panic Disorder and Depression. Relatives of probands with Major Depression plus an Anxiety Disorder were at greater risk for both Major Depression and for an Anxiety Disorder. Panic Disorder, as a subcategory of Anxiety Disorder was associated with the greatest increased risk. Intravenous sodium lactate reliably produces anxiety attacks clinically indistinguishable from those occurring in Panic Disorder, in subjects with that disorder. Panic Disorder is characterized by response to imipramine, an epidemiological link to Affective Disorder, and is similar to panic induced by infusion of sodium lactate.",[],Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,1985-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Rifkin', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Siris', 'firstname': 'S G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,10.1016/0278-5846(85)90177-0,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x16954aac0>,panic-disorder,DepakoteDivalproex Sodium,3887490,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3887490,3

Panic attacks meeting the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, vol. 3 [American Psychiatric Association, 1980] occurred during all three conditions in patients and during the lactate and isoproterenol infusions in normals. Patients had significantly higher average levels of skin conductance, heart rate and state anxiety, and significantly lower finger temperatures compared to normal subjects. However, no measure reliably differentiated panic attacks from nonattack periods.
