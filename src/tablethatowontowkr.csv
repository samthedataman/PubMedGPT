35585196",Physical Activity Effects on Muscle Fatigue in Sport in Active Adults with Long COVID-19: An Observational Study.,"Long COVID-19-related changes in physiology includes alterations in performing muscle work as fatigue. Data available do not allow us to define the usefulness of physical activity to attenuate long COVID-19 functional modifications. The present observational study investigates the effects of physical activity on the perception of fatigue, maximum power output, sleep, and cognitive modifications in subjects affected by long COVID-19, distinguishing between active and sedentary subjects. The data demonstrated the following: the perception of fatigue 1 year after the end of virus positivity was significantly reduced with respect to that observed after 6 months by more than 50% more in active subjects compared to sedentary ones; 6 months after the end of virus positivity, the force developed by active subjects was reduced (RM factor: ","['(EM/CFS)', 'long COVID-19 syndrome', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'muscle fatigue', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome', 'physical exercise', 'sleep quality']","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023-04-14,"[{'lastname': 'Coscia', 'firstname': 'Francesco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Sports Medicine Service of the San Candido, Innichen and Brunico-Bruneck Hospitals, Bolzano-Bozen, 39038 San Candido, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Mancinelli', 'firstname': 'Rosa', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience Imaging and Clinical Sciences, University ""G. d\'Annunzio"" of Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy.\nIIM-Interuniversity Institute of Myology, University ""G. d\'Annunzio"" of Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gigliotti', 'firstname': 'Paola Virginia', 'initials': 'PV', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Sport Physiology San Candido-Innichen, University of Perugia, 39038 San Candido, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Checcaglini', 'firstname': 'Franco', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Campus of Free University of Alcatraz, Free University of Alcatraz, Santa Cristina di Gubbio, 06024 Gubbio, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Fanò-Illic', 'firstname': 'Giorgio', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience Imaging and Clinical Sciences, University ""G. d\'Annunzio"" of Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy.\nIIM-Interuniversity Institute of Myology, University ""G. d\'Annunzio"" of Chieti-Pescara, 66100 Chieti, Italy.\nCampus of Free University of Alcatraz, Free University of Alcatraz, Santa Cristina di Gubbio, 06024 Gubbio, Italy.\nA&C M-C Foundation for Translational Myology, 35100 Padova, Italy.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/diagnostics13071336

1,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,36948138,Objective sleep measures in chronic fatigue syndrome patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) often report disrupted and unrefreshing sleep in association with worsened fatigue symptoms. However, the nature and magnitude of sleep architecture alteration in ME/CFS is not known, with studies using objective sleep measures in ME/CFS generating contradictory results. The current manuscript aimed to review and meta-analyse of case-control studies with objective sleep measures in ME/CSF. A search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Google Scholar, and Psychoinfo databases. After review, 24 studies were included in the meta-analysis, including 20 studies with 801 adults (ME/CFS = 426; controls = 375), and 4 studies with 477 adolescents (ME/CFS = 242; controls = 235), who underwent objective measurement of sleep. Adult ME/CFS patients spend longer time in bed, longer sleep onset latency, longer awake time after sleep onset, reduced sleep efficiency, decreased stage 2 sleep, more Stage 3, and longer rapid eye movement sleep latency. However, adolescent ME/CFS patients had longer time in bed, longer total sleep time, longer sleep onset latency, and reduced sleep efficiency. The meta-analysis results demonstrate that sleep is altered in ME/CFS, with changes seeming to differ between adolescent and adults, and suggesting sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system alterations in ME/CFS.","['Actigraphy watch', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)', 'Objective measurements', 'Polysomnography (PSG)', 'Sleep', 'Systematic review']",Sleep medicine reviews,2023-03-23,"[{'lastname': 'Mohamed', 'firstname': 'Abdalla Z', 'initials': 'AZ', 'affiliation': 'Thompson Institute, University of the Sunshine Coast, 12 Innovation Parkway, Birtinya, QLD, 4575, Australia.

33436406",Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is common in post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC): Results from a post-COVID-19 multidisciplinary clinic.,"The global prevalence of PASC is estimated to be present in 0·43 and based on the WHO estimation of 470 million worldwide COVID-19 infections, corresponds to around 200 million people experiencing long COVID symptoms. Despite this, its clinical features are not well-defined.
We collected retrospective data from 140 patients with PASC in a post-COVID-19 clinic on demographics, risk factors, illness severity (graded as one-mild to five-severe), functional status, and 29 symptoms and principal component symptoms cluster analysis. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) 2015 criteria were used to determine the Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) phenotype.
The median age was 47 years, 59.0% were female; 49.3% White, 17.2% Hispanic, 14.9% Asian, and 6.7% Black. Only 12.7% required hospitalization. Seventy-two (53.5%) patients had no known comorbid conditions. Forty-five (33.9%) were significantly debilitated. The median duration of symptoms was 285.5 days, and the number of symptoms was 12. The most common symptoms were fatigue (86.5%), post-exertional malaise (82.8%), brain fog (81.2%), unrefreshing sleep (76.7%), and lethargy (74.6%). Forty-three percent fit the criteria for ME/CFS, majority were female, and obesity (BMI > 30 Kg/m
Most PASC patients evaluated at our clinic had no comorbid condition and were not hospitalized for acute COVID-19. One-third of patients experienced a severe decline in their functional status. About 43% had the ME/CFS subtype.","['ME/CFS', 'PASC', 'post-COVID-19 clinic', 'prevalence', 'symptoms']",Frontiers in neurology,2023-03-14,"[{'lastname': 'Bonilla', 'firstname': 'Hector', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Quach', 'firstname': 'Tom C', 'initials': 'TC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Tiwari', 'firstname': 'Anushri', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Bonilla', 'firstname': 'Andres E', 'initials': 'AE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Miglis', 'firstname': 'Mitchell', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Phillip C', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Eggert', 'firstname': 'Lauren E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharifi', 'firstname': 'Husham', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Horomanski', 'firstname': 'Audra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Subramanian', 'firstname': 'Aruna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Smirnoff', 'firstname': 'Liza', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Simpson', 'firstname': 'Norah', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Halawi', 'firstname': 'Houssan', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Sum-Ping', 'firstname': 'Oliver', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kalinowski', 'firstname': 'Agnieszka', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Zara M', 'initials': 'ZM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Shafer', 'firstname': 'Robert William', 'initials': 'RW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Geng', 'firstname': 'Linda C', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2023 Bonilla, Quach, Tiwari, Bonilla, Miglis, Yang, Eggert, Sharifi, Horomanski, Subramanian, Smirnoff, Simpson, Halawi, Sum-ping, Kalinowski, Patel, Shafer and Geng.","10.3389/fneur.2023.1090747

11148709","Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia: PR3-versus MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis, an exploratory cross-sectional study.","Persistent fatigue is a common complaint in ANCA-vasculitis (AAV) patients and has a profound impact on patient's quality of life. The symptoms associated with this fatigue mirror those found in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and fibromyalgia. Etiologic and pathophysiologic differences exist between PR3- and MPO-ANCA disease, yet differences in their fatigue manifestations have not been well researched. We compared fatigue and its associations in healthy controls, AAV patients and fibromyalgia controls.
The Canadian consensus criteria were used for ME/CFS diagnosis, and American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia diagnosis. Factors such as cognitive failure, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances were assessed by patient reported questionnaires. Clinical factors such as BVAS, vasculitis damage index, CRP and BMI were also collected.
Our AAV cohort comprised 52 patients, with a mean age of 44.7 (20-79), 57% (30/52) of the patients were female. We found 51.9% (27/52) of patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, with 37% (10/27) of those having comorbid fibromyalgia. Rates of fatigue were higher in MPO-ANCA patients, than in PR3-ANCA patients, and their symptoms were more similar to the fibromyalgia controls. Fatigue in PR3-ANCA patients was related to inflammatory markers. These differences may be due to the varied pathophysiology of the PR3- and MPO-ANCA serotypes.
A large proportion of AAV patients suffer from debilitating fatigue consequential enough to meet the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. Fatigue associations were not the same between PR3- and MPO-ANCA patients, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms may be different. Future studies should consider ANCA serotype, as further research may inform different clinical treatment strategies for AAV patients suffering from ME/CFS.

However, due to the insufficient understanding of the pathogenesis of ME/CFS, there is currently a lack of effective treatment methods. In addition, there are few surveys on the current status of ME/CFS in the central region of China, and the data on ME/CFS among university students in the central region are lacking. This group conducted a survey on university students in Wuhan, Hubei Province in 2022 to collect and analyze the current status of ME/CFS among university students in central China for the first time, aiming to understand the current development of ME/CFS among university students, investigate the influencing factors of its prevalence, fill the data gaps, and provide a reliable basis for developing interventions for chronic fatigue syndrome among university students.
A cross-sectional study was conducted among university students in a university in Hubei province. Data were collected via online questionnaire surveys. The contents included demographic characteristics, lifestyles, disease history, depression, anxiety, sleep, ME/CFS and other associated factors. SAS 9.4 statistical software was used to analyze and estimate the effect of associated factors on ME/CFS.
A total of 1826 subjects were included in the final analysis. The results showed that the prevalence of ME/CFS in university students was 6.25%. Univariate analysis showed that exercise, alcohol consumption, study, overnights, diet, anxiety, depression, and sleep quality were associated with ME/CFS (
College students should pay enough attention to ME/CFS, improve their understanding of ME/CFS, and improve people's ability to understand ME/CFS.","['anxiety', 'associated factors', 'chronic fatigue

31115729",Improvement of Long COVID symptoms over one year.,"Early and accurate diagnosis and treatment of Long COVID, clinically known as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), may mitigate progression to chronic diseases such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Our objective was to determine the utility of the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) to assess the frequency and severity of common symptoms of ME/CFS, to diagnose and monitor symptoms in patients with PASC.
This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled 185 people that included 34 patients with PASC that had positive COVID-19 test and persistent symptoms of >3 months and 151 patients diagnosed with ME/CFS. PASC patients were followed over 1 year and responded to the DSQ at baseline and 12 months. ME/CFS patients responded to the DSQ at baseline and 1 year later. Changes in symptoms over time were analyzed using a fixed-effects model to compute difference-in-differences estimates between baseline and 1-year follow-up assessments.
Patients were defined as having PASC if they had a previous positive COVID-19 test, were experiencing symptoms of fatigue, post-exertional malaise, or other unwellness for at least 3 months, were not hospitalized for COVID-19, had no documented major medical or psychiatric diseases prior to COVID-19, and had no other active and untreated disease processes that could explain their symptoms. PASC patients were recruited in 2021. ME/CFS patients were recruited in 2017.
At baseline, patients with PASC had similar symptom severity and frequency as patients with ME/CFS and satisfied ME/CFS diagnostic criteria. ME/CFS patients experienced significantly more severe unrefreshing sleep and flu-like symptoms. Five symptoms improved significantly over the course of 1 year for PASC patients including fatigue, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, irritable bowel symptoms and feeling unsteady. In contrast, there were no significant symptom improvements for ME/CFS patients.
There were considerable similarities between patients with PASC and ME/CFS at baseline. However, symptoms improved for PASC patients over the course of a year but not for ME/CFS patients. PASC patients with significant symptom improvement no longer met ME/CFS clinical diagnostic criteria. These findings indicate that the DSQ can be used to reliably assess and monitor PASC symptoms.","['Long COVID', 'brain fog', 'fatigue', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'post-acute COVID-19 syndrome', 'post-exertional malaise', 'unrefreshing sleep']",Frontiers in medicine,2023-01-27,"[{'lastname': 'Oliveira', 'firstname': 'Carlos R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Section of Infectious Diseases and Global Health, Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States.\nSection of Health Informatics, Department of Biostatistics, Yale University School of Public Health, New Haven, CT, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Unutmaz', 'firstname': 'Derya', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Bateman', 'firstname': 'Lucinda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Bateman Horne Center, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Vernon', 'firstname': 'Suzanne D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Bateman Horne Center, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.'}]",None,None,"At baseline, patients with PASC had similar symptom severity and frequency as patients with ME/CFS and satisfied ME/CFS diagnostic criteria.

27729349",Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in Adolescents: Practical Guidance and Management Challenges.,"This paper reviews the current understanding of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), and whether any treatment strategies have been effective. ME/CFS is a condition of as yet unknown etiology that commonly follows an infective process. It includes a new onset of fatigue (of more than 3-6 month duration and not relieved by rest), post-exertional malaise, cognitive difficulties and unrefreshing sleep, and frequently orthostatic intolerance, somatic symptoms and pain. Long COVID has renewed interest in the condition and stimulated research with findings suggestive of a multisystem neuroimmune disease. There are no definitively effective treatments. Despite earlier recommendations regarding graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavior therapy, the current recommendations are managing symptoms, with lifestyle management and supportive care. This paper provides an outline of strategies that young people and their families have reported as helpful in managing a chronic illness that impacts their life socially, physically, emotionally, cognitively and educationally. As the illness frequently occurs at a time of rapid developmental changes, reducing these impacts is reported to be as important as managing the physical symptoms. Young people face a mean duration of 5 years illness (range 1-16 years) with a likely residual 20% having significant restrictions after 10 years. Their feedback has suggested that symptom management, self-management strategies, advocacy and educational liaison have been the most helpful. They value professionals who will listen and take them seriously, and after excluding alternative diagnoses, they explain the diagnosis, are supportive and assist in monitoring their progress. Remaining engaged in education was the best predictor of later functioning. This allowed for social connections, as well as potential independence and fulfilling some aspirations. The need to consider the impact of this chronic illness on all aspects of adolescent development, as part of management, is highlighted.","['chronic fatigue syndrome', 'chronic illness', 'interventions', 'self-management']","Adolescent health, medicine and therapeutics",2023-01-13,"[{'lastname': 'Rowe', 'firstname': 'Katherine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Department of General Medicine, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""}]",None,None,None,© 2023 Rowe.,"10.2147/AHMT.S317314

29305563",Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Post-COVID Syndrome: A Common Neuroimmune Ground?,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating chronic disease of unknown etiology, sharing a similar clinical presentation with the increasingly recognized post-COVID syndrome. We performed the first cross-sectional study of ME/CFS in a community population in Russia. Then we described and compared some clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of ME/CFS and post-COVID syndrome as neuroimmune disorders. Of the cohort of 76 individuals who suggested themselves as suffering from ME/CFS, 56 were diagnosed with ME/CFS by clinicians according to ≥1 of the four most commonly used case definitions. Of the cohort of 14 individuals with post-COVID-19 syndrome, 14 met the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS. The severity of anxiety/depressive symptoms did not correlate with the severity of fatigue either in ME/CFS or in post-COVID ME/CFS. Still, a positive correlation was found between the severity of fatigue and 20 other symptoms of ME/CFS related to the domains of ""post-exertional exhaustion"", ""immune dysfunction"", ""sleep disturbances"", ""dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system"", ""neurological sensory/motor disorders"" and ""pain syndromes"". Immunological abnormalities were identified in 12/12 patients with ME/CFS according to the results of laboratory testing. The prevalence of postural orthostatic tachycardia assessed in the active orthostatic test amounted to 37.5% in ME/CFS and 75.0% in post-COVID ME/CFS (the latter was higher than in healthy controls, ","['chronic fatigue syndrome', 'immune system', 'microcirculation', 'post-COVID syndrome', 'postural orthostatic tachycardia']","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023-01-09,"[{'lastname': 'Ryabkova', 'firstname': 'Varvara A', 'initials': 'VA', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of the Mosaic of Autoimmunity and Department of Pathology, Saint Petersburg State University, 199034 Saint-Petersburg, Russia.\nDepartment of Hospital Therapy Named after Academician M.V.

8,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,36573005,Three-Month Symptom Profiles Among Symptomatic Adults With Positive and Negative Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Tests: A Prospective Cohort Study From the INSPIRE Group.,"Long-term symptoms following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are a major concern, yet their prevalence is poorly understood.
We conducted a prospective cohort study comparing adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection (coronavirus disease-positive [COVID+]) with adults who tested negative (COVID-), enrolled within 28 days of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved SARS-CoV-2 test result for active symptoms. Sociodemographic characteristics, symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection (assessed with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] Person Under Investigation Symptom List), and symptoms of post-infectious syndromes (ie, fatigue, sleep quality, muscle/joint pains, unrefreshing sleep, and dizziness/fainting, assessed with CDC Short Symptom Screener for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome) were assessed at baseline and 3 months via electronic surveys sent via text or email.
Among the first 1000 participants, 722 were COVID+ and 278 were COVID-. Mean age was 41.5 (SD 15.2); 66.3% were female, 13.4% were Black, and 15.3% were Hispanic. At baseline, SARS-CoV-2 symptoms were more common in the COVID+ group than the COVID- group. At 3 months, SARS-CoV-2 symptoms declined in both groups, although were more prevalent in the COVID+ group: upper respiratory symptoms/head/eyes/ears/nose/throat (HEENT; 37.3% vs 20.9%), constitutional (28.8% vs 19.4%), musculoskeletal (19.5% vs 14.7%), pulmonary (17.6% vs 12.2%), cardiovascular (10.0% vs 7.2%), and gastrointestinal (8.7% vs 8.3%); only 50.2% and 73.3% reported no symptoms at all. Symptoms of post-infectious syndromes were similarly prevalent among the COVID+ and COVID- groups at 3 months.
Approximately half of COVID+ participants, as compared with one-quarter of COVID- participants, had at least 1 SARS-CoV-2 symptom at 3 months, highlighting the need for future work to distinguish long COVID.

33847020",Characteristics of Sleep Disturbance in Patients with Long COVID: A Retrospective Observational Study in Japan.,"The objective of this study was to determine the clinical and endocrinological features of sleep disturbance in patients with long COVID.
This study was a single-center retrospective observational study for patients who visited the COVID-19 aftercare outpatient clinic (CAC) established in Okayama University Hospital in Japan during the period from 15 February 2021 to 29 July 2022. The long COVID patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of sleep disturbance, and the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the patients were analyzed.
Out of 363 patients with long COVID, after excluding 6 patients, 60 patients (16.5%) (55% males, median age of 38 years) complaining of sleep disturbance were compared with 303 patients (83.5%) (43% males, median age of 40 years) without sleep-related symptoms. Although there were no significant differences in clinical backgrounds and severities of COVID-19 between the two groups by the multivariate analysis, the percentage of long COVID patients with sleep disturbance was significantly increased among patients infected in the Omicron-dominant phase. In addition, the prevalence rate of sleep disturbance in patients when infected in the Omicron phase (24.8%) was two-times higher than that in patients infected in the Delta phase (12.8%). Of note, the percentages of patients with sleep disturbance who also complained of general fatigue, headache, concentration loss, anxiety, low-grade fever, and brain fog symptoms were higher than the percentages of patients without sleep disturbance who had the same complaints. Among the types of sleep disturbance, the percentage of patients who complained of loss of sleep induction (75%) was much higher than the percentage of patients with early-awakening sleep disturbance (6.7%), and many of the patients with mid-awakening types of insomnia had brain fog symptoms. Endocrine examinations revealed that long COVID patients with sleep disturbance had significantly higher levels of plasma adrenocorticotropin and lower levels of serum growth hormone, suggesting the presence of hypothalamic-pituitary stress.
The prevalence of sleep disturbance has been increasing in long COVID patients infected in the Omicron phase with a certain clinical and endocrine trend.","['Omicron variant', 'chronic fatigue', 'insomnia', 'long COVID', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'post COVID-19 condition']",Journal of clinical medicine,2022-12-24,"[{'lastname': 'Sunada', 'firstname': 'Naruhiko', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakano', 'firstname': 'Yasuhiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Otsuka', 'firstname': 'Yuki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tokumasu', 'firstname': 'Kazuki', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Honda', 'firstname': 'Hiroyuki', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Sakurada', 'firstname': 'Yasue', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Matsuda', 'firstname': 'Yui', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hasegawa', 'firstname': 'Toru', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Omura', 'firstname': 'Daisuke', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ochi', 'firstname': 'Kanako', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Center for Education in Medicine and Health Sciences, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hagiya', 'firstname': 'Hideharu', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ueda', 'firstname': 'Keigo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kataoka', 'firstname': 'Hitomi', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Otsuka', 'firstname': 'Fumio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of General Medicine, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.'}]",None,The prevalence of sleep disturbance has been increasing in long COVID patients infected in the Omicron phase with a certain clinical and endocrine trend.,"Out of 363 patients with long COVID, after excluding 6 patients, 60 patients (16.5%) (55% males, median age of 38 years) complaining of sleep disturbance were compared with 303 patients (83.5%) (43% males, median age of 40 years) without sleep-related symptoms.

35755863",Genetic risk factors for ME/CFS identified using combinatorial analysis.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating chronic disease that lacks known pathogenesis, distinctive diagnostic criteria, and effective treatment options. Understanding the genetic (and other) risk factors associated with the disease would begin to help to alleviate some of these issues for patients.
We applied both GWAS and the PrecisionLife combinatorial analytics platform to analyze ME/CFS cohorts from UK Biobank, including the Pain Questionnaire cohort, in a case-control design with 1000 cycles of fully random permutation. Results from this study were supported by a series of replication and cohort comparison experiments, including use of disjoint Verbal Interview CFS, post-viral fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia cohorts also derived from UK Biobank, and compared results for overlap and reproducibility.
Combinatorial analysis revealed 199 SNPs mapping to 14 genes that were significantly associated with 91% of the cases in the ME/CFS population. These SNPs were found to stratify by shared cases into 15 clusters (communities) made up of 84 high-order combinations of between 3 and 5 SNPs. p-values for these communities range from 2.3 × 10
This study provides the first detailed genetic insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning ME/CFS and offers new approaches for better diagnosis and treatment of patients.","['Biomarkers', 'Combinatorial analytics', 'ME/CFS', 'Novel targets', 'Patient stratification', 'Precision repositioning']",Journal of translational medicine,2022-12-15,"[{'lastname': 'Das', 'firstname': 'Sayoni', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'PrecisionLife Ltd, Long Hanborough, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Taylor', 'firstname': 'Krystyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'PrecisionLife Ltd, Long Hanborough, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Kozubek', 'firstname': 'James', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'PrecisionLife Ltd, Long Hanborough, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Sardell', 'firstname': 'Jason', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'PrecisionLife Ltd, Long Hanborough, Oxford, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gardner', 'firstname': 'Steve', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'PrecisionLife Ltd, Long Hanborough, Oxford, UK. steve@precisionlife.com.'}]",None,None,Combinatorial analysis revealed 199 SNPs mapping to 14 genes that were significantly associated with 91% of the cases in the ME/CFS population.

30311972","Brain fog of post-COVID-19 condition and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, same medical disorder?","Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by persistent physical and mental fatigue. The post-COVID-19 condition patients refer physical fatigue and cognitive impairment sequelae. Given the similarity between both conditions, could it be the same pathology with a different precipitating factor?
To describe the cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and general symptomatology in both groups, to find out if it is the same pathology. As well as verify if the affectation of smell is related to cognitive deterioration in patients with post-COVID-19 condition.
The sample included 42 ME/CFS and 73 post-COVID-19 condition patients. Fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety and depressive symptoms, the frequency and severity of different symptoms, olfactory function and a wide range of cognitive domains were evaluated.
Both syndromes are characterized by excessive physical fatigue, sleep problems and myalgia. Sustained attention and processing speed were impaired in 83.3% and 52.4% of ME/CFS patients while in post-COVID-19 condition were impaired in 56.2% and 41.4% of patients, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found in sustained attention and visuospatial ability, being the ME/CFS group who presented the worst performance. Physical problems and mood issues were the main variables correlating with cognitive performance in post-COVID-19 patients, while in ME/CFS it was anxiety symptoms and physical fatigue.
The symptomatology and cognitive patterns were similar in both groups, with greater impairment in ME/CFS. This disease is characterized by greater physical and neuropsychiatric problems compared to post-COVID-19 condition. Likewise, we also propose the relevance of prolonged hyposmia as a possible marker of cognitive deterioration in patients with post-COVID-19.","['Brain fog', 'Cognition', 'Hyposmia', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Neuropsychological impairment', 'Post-COVID-19 condition', 'SARS-CoV-2']",Journal of translational medicine,2022-12-07,"[{'lastname': 'Azcue', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gómez-Esteban', 'firstname': 'J C', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.\nDepartment of Neurology, Cruces University Hospital, Barakaldo, Spain.\nDepartment of Neurosciences, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Acera', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Tijero', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.\nDepartment of Neurology, Cruces University Hospital, Barakaldo, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernandez', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.\nDepartment of Neurology, Cruces University Hospital, Barakaldo, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ayo-Mentxakatorre', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Pérez-Concha', 'firstname': 'T', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Cruces University Hospital, Barakaldo, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Murueta-Goyena', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.\nDepartment of Neurosciences, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Lafuente', 'firstname': 'J V', 'initials': 'JV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Prada', 'firstname': 'Á', 'initials': 'Á', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology, Donostia University Hospital, San Sebastián, Spain.\nSpanish Network for the Research in Multiple Sclerosis, Donostia/San Sebastian, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'López de Munain', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Donostia University Hospital, San Sebastián, Spain.\nDepartment of Neurosciences, Biodonostia Health Research Institute, San Sebastián, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruiz-Irastorza', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Autoimmune Diseases Research Unit, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ribacoba', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, Cruces University Hospital, Barakaldo, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gabilondo', 'firstname': 'I', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.\nDepartment of Neurology, Cruces University Hospital, Barakaldo, Spain.\nThe Basque Foundation for Science, IKERBASQUE, Bilbao, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Del Pino', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Neurodegenerative Diseases Group, Biocruces Bizkaia Health Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain. delpinorocio@gmail.com.'}]",None,None,"Both syndromes are characterized by excessive physical fatigue, sleep problems and myalgia.

23078984",Mindfulness Meditation Interventions for Long COVID: Biobehavioral Gene Expression and Neuroimmune Functioning.,"Some individuals infected with SARS CoV-2 have developed Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC) or what has been referred to as Long COVID. Efforts are underway to find effective treatment strategies for those with Long COVID. One possible approach involves alternative medical interventions, which have been widely used to treat and manage symptoms of a variety of medical problems including post-viral infections. Meditation has been found to reduce fatigue and unrefreshing sleep, and for those with post-viral infections, it has enhanced immunity, and reduced inflammatory-driven pathogenesis. Our article summarizes the literature on what is known about mindfulness meditation interventions, and reviews evidence on how it may apply to those with Long COVID and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Evidence is reviewed suggesting effective and sustainable outcomes may be achieved for symptomatology and underlying pathology of post-viral fatigue (PASC and ME/CFS).","['Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'long COVID', 'meditation']",Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment,2022-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Porter', 'firstname': 'Nicole', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}]",None,None,None,© 2022 Porter and Jason.,"10.2147/NDT.S379653

31300409",Key Features of a Multi-Disciplinary Hospital-Based Rehabilitation Program for Children and Adolescents with Moderate to Severe Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome ME/CFS.,"There is limited published data on treatment or outcomes of children and young people (CYP) with moderate or severe Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Here, we describe outcomes of moderate and severe ME/CFS in CYP treated in a tertiary adolescent service. This information is useful when planning services for CYP and families affected by moderate/severe ME/CFS and to guide future management trials and commissioning decisions.
A retrospective review was conducted of medical records of the 27 CYP who received ward-based treatment in 2015. Notes were retrospectively reviewed to assess progress in four markers of wellbeing over the period of treatment: (i) mobility, (ii) education, (iii) sleep and (iv) involvement in social/recreational activities.
A total of 23/27 (85%) showed improvement in one or more domains over their period of ward-based therapy. 19/27 (70%) of patients showed improvement in physical ability. In 15/23 patients (65%), there was an improvement in ability to access education, in 12/24 (50%) sleep improved, and 16/27 (59%) demonstrated an improvement in socialising/ability perform recreational activities.
A multidisciplinary hospital-based rehabilitation programme for moderate and severe ME/CFS was associated with improvement in at least one area of wellbeing in 85% of the CYP we reviewed. These data may be used as a baseline to evaluate the impact of other models of delivering care for this patient group. It may be useful when considering other groups such as those affected by Post-COVID Syndrome.","['adolescent', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'inpatient', 'long COVID', 'measure', 'moderate', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'myalgic encephalopathy', 'outcomes', 'severe', 'treatment', 'young people']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-10-28,"[{'lastname': 'Hiremath', 'firstname': 'Sonya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Victoria Hospital Kirkaldy, NHS Fife, Kirkcaldy KY2 5AH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Doukrou', 'firstname': 'Montserrat', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""St Bernard's Hospital, Gibraltar Health Authority, Gibraltar GX11 1AA, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Flannery', 'firstname': 'Halina', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London NW1 2BU, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Carey', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London NW1 2BU, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Gregorowski', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London NW1 2BU, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Ward', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'UCL GOS Institute of Child Health, London WC1N 1EH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hargreaves', 'firstname': 'Dougal', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'School of Public health, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Segal', 'firstname': 'Terry Yvonne', 'initials': 'TY', 'affiliation': 'University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London NW1 2BU, UK.'}]",None,None,"A total of 23/27 (85%) showed improvement in one or more domains over their period of ward-based therapy. 19/27 (70%) of patients showed improvement in physical ability.

35317812",Long-term neuromuscular consequences of SARS-Cov-2 and their similarities with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: results of the retrospective CoLGEM study.,"Patients with long-COVID often complain of continuous fatigue, myalgia, sleep problems, cognitive dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise. No data are available on EMG recording of evoked myopotentials (M-waves) or exercise-induced alterations in long-COVID patients, providing evidence of muscle membrane fatigue. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) develops in more than half of patients after an infectious disease, particularly viral diseases. A large proportion (around 70%) of these patients have neuromuscular disorders with M-wave alterations during and after exercise. Our hypothesis was that M-wave alterations would be also found in long-COVID patients, in association with neuromuscular symptoms, similar to ME/CFS.
This retrospective observational ColGEM (Covid LonG Encéphalomyelite Myalgique) study compared 59 patients with long-COVID and 55 ME/CFS patients with a history of severe infection who presented before the COVID pandemic. All of these patients underwent the same protocol consisting of a questionnaire focusing on neural and neuromuscular disorders and M-wave recording in the rectus femoris muscle before, during, and 10 min after a progressive cycling exercise. Maximal handgrip strength (MHGS) and maximal exercise power were also measured. The frequency of symptoms and magnitude of M-wave changes in the two groups were compared using non-parametric and parametric tests.
The frequency of fatigue, myalgia, sleep problems, cognitive dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise as well as the magnitude of exercise-induced M-wave alterations were the same in the two groups. By contrast, digestive problems were less present in long-COVID. M-wave alterations were greater in ME/CFS patients as in those with long-COVID when the highest muscle strength and highest exercise performance were measured.
These high clinical and biological similarities between long-COVID and ME/CFS support the hypothesis that SARS-Cov-2 infection can cause ME/CFS symptoms.

18,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,36153118,Exosome-associated mitochondrial DNA from patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome stimulates human microglia to release IL-1β.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disease that presents with fatigue, sleep disturbances, malaise, and cognitive problems. The pathogenesis of ME/CFS is presently unknown, and serum levels of potential biomarkers have been inconsistent. Here, we show that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) associated with serum exosomes, is increased in ME/CFS patients only after exercise. Moreover, exosomes isolated from patients with ME/CFS stimulate significant release of IL-1β from cultured human microglia. These results provide evidence that activation of microglia by serum-derived exosomes may serve as a potential novel pathogenetic factor and target for treatment of ME/CFS.","['allergies', 'cytokines', 'exosomes', 'extracellular vesicles', 'inflammation', 'mitochondrial DNA', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome', 'neuropeptides']",The European journal of neuroscience,2022-09-25,"[{'lastname': 'Tsilioni', 'firstname': 'Irene', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Immunopharmacology and Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Immunology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Natelson', 'firstname': 'Benjamin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Pain and Fatigue Study Center, Department of Neurology, Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Theoharides', 'firstname': 'Theoharis C', 'initials': 'TC', 'affiliation': 'Molecular Immunopharmacology and Drug Discovery Laboratory, Department of Immunology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.\nSchool of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Program in Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine and Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Tufts University School of Medicine and Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.'}]",None,None,None,© 2022 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/ejn.15828,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x15240e430>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,36153118,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36153118,1,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

6880820","A comparison of pain, fatigue, and function between post-COVID-19 condition, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: a survey study.","A growing number of individuals report prolonged symptoms following acute Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection, known as post-COVID-19 condition (post-COVID-19). While studies have emerged investigating the symptom sequelae of post-COVID-19, there has been limited investigation into the characterization of pain, fatigue, and function in these individuals, despite initial reports of a clinical phenotype similar to fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). This study aimed to characterize multiple symptom domains in individuals reporting post-COVID-19 and compare its clinical phenotype with those with FMS and CFS. A total of 707 individuals with a single or comorbid diagnosis of post-COVID-19, FMS, and/or CFS completed multiple surveys assessing self-reported pain, fatigue, physical and cognitive function, catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, anxiety, depression, dyspnea, and sleep quality. In all 3 diagnoses, elevated pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia were reported. Physical and cognitive function were similarly impacted among individuals with post-COVID-19, FMS, and CFS; however, individuals with post-COVID-19 reported lower pain and fatigue than FMS and CFS. The comorbid diagnosis of post-COVID-19 with FMS and/or CFS further exacerbated pain, fatigue, and psychological domains when compared with post-COVID-19 alone. In summary, individuals with post-COVID-19 report a symptom phenotype similar to FMS and CFS, negatively impacting cognitive and physical function, but with less severe pain and fatigue overall. These findings may help direct future investigations of the benefit of a biopsychosocial approach to the clinical management of post-COVID-19.",[],Pain,2022-08-26,"[{'lastname': 'Haider', 'firstname': 'Saman', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Janowski', 'firstname': 'Adam J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Lesnak', 'firstname': 'Joseph B', 'initials': 'JB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Hayashi', 'firstname': 'Kazuhiro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Dailey', 'firstname': 'Dana L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy, St. Ambrose University, Davenport, IA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Chimenti', 'firstname': 'Ruth', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Frey-Law', 'firstname': 'Laura A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Sluka', 'firstname': 'Kathleen A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Berardi', 'firstname': 'Giovanni', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, United States.'}]",None,None,None,Copyright © 2022 International Association for the Study of Pain.,10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002711,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x15242b1a0>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,36006296,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36006296,4,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

29635081",[Post-COVID syndrome with fatigue and exercise intolerance: myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome].,"A sizable part of post-COVID syndrome meets the diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). A doubling of cases of ME/CFS within the next years is therefore projected.
Presentation of the current state of knowledge on ME/CFS.
Unsystematic review of the literature and of own contributions in research and patient care.
ME/CFS is a neuroimmunological disease, mostly infection-induced, usually persisting throughout life. Clinically it is characterized by fatigue lasting at least 6 months and the defining core feature of exercise intolerance (post-exertional malaise, PEM). Exercise intolerance is defined as a worsening of symptoms after (even mild) everyday exertion, which usually begins after several hours or on the following day, is still noticeable at least 14 h after exertion, and often lasts for several days (up to weeks or longer). Furthermore, ME/CFS is characterized by pain, disturbances of sleep, thinking and memory, and dysregulation of the circulatory, endocrine, and immune systems. As a separate clinical entity, ME/CFS should be distinguished from chronic fatigue, which occurs as a symptom of a range of very different diseases. The diagnosis of ME/CFS is made clinically using established international diagnostic criteria and requires careful stepwise diagnosis to exclude other diagnoses. A causal therapy for ME/CFS has not been established; the focus is on symptoms relief, treatment of the often accompanying orthostatic intolerance, and assistance with anticipatory energy management (pacing).
HINTERGRUND: Ein erheblicher Teil der Verläufe des Post-COVID-Syndroms (COVID „coronavirus disease“) erfüllt die Diagnosekriterien für Myalgische Enzephalomyelitis/Chronisches Fatigue-Syndrom (ME/CFS). In den nächsten Jahren muss deshalb mit einer Verdopplung der Zahl der von ME/CFS Betroffenen gerechnet werden.
Darstellung des aktuellen Wissensstands zu ME/CFS.
Unsystematisches Review der Literatur sowie eigener Arbeiten in Forschung und Patient*innenversorgung.
Bei ME/CFS handelt es sich um eine zumeist infektinduzierte, in der Regel lebenslang persistierende neuroimmunologische Erkrankung mit mindestens 6 Monate anhaltender Fatigue und dem definierenden Kernmerkmal der Belastungsintoleranz („post-exertional malaise“ [PEM]). Darunter versteht man eine nach (auch leichter) Alltagsanstrengung auftretende Verschlechterung der Beschwerden, die meist erst nach mehreren Stunden oder am Folgetag einsetzt, mindestens 14 h nach Belastung noch spürbar ist und oft mehrere Tage (bis Wochen oder länger) anhält. Des Weiteren bestehen bei ME/CFS Schmerzen, Störungen von Schlaf, Denk- und Merkfähigkeit sowie Fehlregulationen von Kreislauf, Hormon- und Immunsystem. Als eigenständige klinische Entität ist ME/CFS von der chronischen Fatigue abzugrenzen, die als Symptom bei ganz unterschiedlichen Erkrankungen auftritt. Die Diagnose ME/CFS wird anhand etablierter internationaler Diagnosekriterien klinisch gestellt und erfordert zum Ausschluss anderer Diagnosen eine sorgfältige Stufendiagnostik. Eine kausale Therapie für ME/CFS ist nicht etabliert, im Vordergrund steht die Linderung der Beschwerden, die Behandlung der oft begleitenden orthostatischen Intoleranz sowie die Unterstützung beim vorausschauenden Energiemanagement („pacing“).","['Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Long COVID', 'Pacing', 'Post exertional malaise', 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type\xa02 (SARS-CoV-2)']","Innere Medizin (Heidelberg, Germany)",2022-08-05,"[{'lastname': 'Renz-Polster', 'firstname': 'Herbert', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': ', Rohrmoos\xa010, 88267, Vogt, Deutschland. herbert.renz-polster@posteo.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Scheibenbogen', 'firstname': 'Carmen', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Charité Fatigue Centrum der Charité\xa0- Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Augustenburger Platz 1 (Südstr. 2), 13353, Berlin, Deutschland. carmen.scheibenbogen@charite.de.'}]",None,None,None,"© 2022.

31943975",Assessing sleep and pain among adults with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: psychometric evaluation of the PROMIS® sleep and pain short forms.,"To evaluate the psychometric properties of the patient-reported outcome measurement information system® (PROMIS) short forms for assessing sleep disturbance, sleep-related impairment, pain interference, and pain behavior, among adults with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).
Data came from the Multi-Site ME/CFS study conducted between 2012 and 2020 at seven ME/CFS specialty clinics across the USA. Baseline and follow-up data from ME/CFS and healthy control (HC) groups were used to examine ceiling/floor effects, internal consistency reliability, differential item functioning (DIF), known-groups validity, and responsiveness.
A total of 945 participants completed the baseline assessment (602 ME/CFS and 338 HC) and 441 ME/CFS also completed the follow-up. The baseline mean T-scores of PROMIS sleep and pain measures ranged from 57.68 to 62.40, about one standard deviation above the national norm (T-score = 50). All four measures showed high internal consistency (ω = 0.92 to 0.97) and no substantial floor/ceiling effects. No DIF was detected by age or sex. Known-groups comparisons among ME/CFS groups with low, medium, and high functional impairment showed significant small-sized differences in scores (η
The PROMIS sleep and pain measures demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties supporting their use in ME/CFS research and clinical practice.","['Differential item functioning', 'Internal consistency reliability', 'Known-groups validity', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)', 'Pain', 'Responsiveness', 'Sleep']","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2022-07-28,"[{'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Manshu', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Rhode Island, 142 Flagg Road, Kingston, RI, 02881, USA. myang@uri.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Keller', 'firstname': 'San', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'American Institutes for Research, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Jin-Mann S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA.'}]",None,The PROMIS sleep and pain measures demonstrated satisfactory psychometric properties supporting their use in ME/CFS research and clinical practice.,"A total of 945 participants completed the baseline assessment (602 ME/CFS and 338 HC) and 441 ME/CFS also completed the follow-up.

34643720",Molecular Mechanisms of Neuroinflammation in ME/CFS and Long COVID to Sustain Disease and Promote Relapses.,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disease now well-documented as having arisen commonly from a viral infection, but also from other external stressors, like exposure to agricultural chemicals, other types of infection, surgery, or other severe stress events. Research has shown these events produce a systemic molecular inflammatory response and chronic immune activation and dysregulation. What has been more difficult to establish is the hierarchy of the physiological responses that give rise to the myriad of symptoms that ME/CFS patients experience, and why they do not resolve and are generally life-long. The severity of the symptoms frequently fluctuates through relapse recovery periods, with brain-centered symptoms of neuroinflammation, loss of homeostatic control, ""brain fog"" affecting cognitive ability, lack of refreshing sleep, and poor response to even small stresses. How these brain effects develop with ME/CFS from the initiating external effector, whether virus or other cause, is poorly understood and that is what our paper aims to address. We propose the hypothesis that following the initial stressor event, the subsequent systemic pathology moves to the brain ","['Long COVID', 'ME/CFS', 'disease persistence', 'neuroinflammation', 'relapse', 'systemic inflammation']",Frontiers in neurology,2022-06-14,"[{'lastname': 'Tate', 'firstname': 'Warren', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.\nBrain Health Research Centre, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Walker', 'firstname': 'Max', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Sweetman', 'firstname': 'Eiren', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.\nSchool of Biological Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Helliwell', 'firstname': 'Amber', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Peppercorn', 'firstname': 'Katie', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.\nBrain Health Research Centre, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Edgar', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Blair', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School of Health, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chatterjee', 'firstname': 'Aniruddha', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2022 Tate, Walker, Sweetman, Helliwell, Peppercorn, Edgar, Blair and Chatterjee.","10.3389/fneur.2022.877772

33925784","Separating Patients with SEID from Those with CFS in the French ME/CFS Association, with Some Thoughts on Nomenclature.","In 2015, the American Institute of Medicine, now called the National Academy of Medicine, (IOM/NAM) proposed new diagnostic criteria for both Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and a new label: Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID). This study aimed to evaluate the SEID criteria among members of the French Association of ME/CFS (ASFC) and their opinion about this new name. We sent an anonymous questionnaire to 494 ASFC members, using French-translated questions derived from the IOM/NAM tool kit. Among the 178/231 responding subjects who reported ME/CFS diagnosis, 150 (84%) met the criteria of SEID. For each set of questions, we identified some of them that significantly distinguished SEID from non-SEID patients concerning unrefreshing sleep, cognitive disorders, and orthostatic intolerance items. Forty-six percent of the respondents considered the ""SEID"" terminology as more appropriate than ""CFS"", 39% considered it inappropriate, and 15% had no opinion. Some questions better identified the SEID criteria. The IOM/NAM SEID criteria captured a large part of ASFC members suffering from ME/CFS. However, this new SEID label was not well accepted by the subjects, nor were the other denominations, suggesting that a better term should be found. Pending development of specific markers, further work with patient communities is needed to find a more suitable label.","['case definition', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'patient association', 'patient opinion', 'systemic exertion intolerance disease']","Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)",2022-05-29,"[{'lastname': 'Campagne', 'firstname': 'Julien', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine Department, University of Lorraine, 34, Cours Leopold, CS 25233, CEDEX, 54052 Nancy, France.\nInternal Medicine Department, University Hospital of Nancy, Rue du Morvan, CEDEX, 54511 Vandœuvre-Lès-Nancy, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Fornasieri', 'firstname': 'Isabelle', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Psychology, University of Strasbourg, 12, Rue Goethe, 67000 Strasbourg, France.\nFrench Association for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ASFC), Maison des Associations Nice Centre, 3 bis, rue Guigonis, 06300 Nice, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Andreani', 'firstname': 'Barbara', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Regional Center for Scientific Documentation and Clinical Research, Legouest Army Instruction Hospital, 27, Avenue de Plantières, 57077 Metz, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Eginard', 'firstname': 'Monique', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'French Association for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ASFC), 25, Impasse des Lavandes, 13710 Fuveau, France.'}, {'lastname': 'de Korwin', 'firstname': 'Jean-Dominique', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Internal Medicine Department, University of Lorraine, 34, Cours Leopold, CS 25233, CEDEX, 54052 Nancy, France.\nInternal Medicine Department, University Hospital of Nancy, Rue du Morvan, CEDEX, 54511 Vandœuvre-Lès-Nancy, France.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/diagnostics12051095

18055455",Circadian rhythm disruption in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: Implications for the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a common and disabling disorder primarily characterized by persistent fatigue and exercise intolerance, with associated sleep disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, and cognitive problems. The causes of ME/CFS are not well understood but may coincide with immune and inflammatory responses following viral infections. During the current SARS-CoV2 coronavirus pandemic, ME/CFS has been increasingly reported to overlap with persistent ""long COVID"" symptoms, also called the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Given the prominence of activity and sleep problems in ME/CFS, circadian rhythm disruption has been examined as a contributing factor in ME/CFS. While these studies of circadian rhythms have been pursued for decades, evidence linking circadian rhythms to ME/CFS remains inconclusive. A major limitation of older chronobiology studies of ME/CFS was the unavailability of modern molecular methods to study circadian rhythms and incomplete understanding of circadian rhythms outside the brain in peripheral organ systems. Major methodological and conceptual advancements in chronobiology have since been made. Over the same time, biomarker research in ME/CFS has progressed. Together, these new developments may justify renewed interest in circadian rhythm research in ME/CFS. Presently, we review ME/CFS from the perspective of circadian rhythms, covering both older and newer studies that make use of modern molecular methods. We focus on transforming growth factor beta (TGFB), a cytokine that has been previously associated with ME/CFS and has an important role in circadian rhythms, especially in peripheral cells. We propose that disrupted TGFB signaling in ME/CFS may play a role in disrupting physiological rhythms in sleep, activity, and cognition, leading to the insomnia, energy disturbances, cognition problems, depression, and autonomic dysfunction associated with ME/CFS. Since SARS-like coronavirus infections cause persistent changes in TGFB and previous coronavirus outbreaks have caused ME/CFS-like syndromes, chronobiological considerations may have immediate implications for understanding ME/CFS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly suggest new avenues for therapeutic interventions.","['Activity', 'COVID-19', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Circadian rhythm', 'Cytokine', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Sleep', 'Temperature', 'Transforming growth factor beta']","Brain, behavior, & immunity - health",2022-04-26,"[{'lastname': 'McCarthy', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'UC San Diego Department of Psychiatry and Center for Circadian Biology, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla CA 92093, USA.\nVA San Diego Medical Center, San Diego CA, 3350 La Jolla Village Dr MC 116A, San Diego CA, 92161, USA.'}]",None,None,None,Published by Elsevier Inc.,10.1016/j.bbih.2022.100412,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x152285800>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,35465246,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35465246,8,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan
28,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,35421511,The underlying sex differences in neuroendocrine adaptations relevant to Myalgic Encephalomyelitis Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex multisystem disease characterised by severe and disabling new-onset symptoms of post-exertional malaise (PEM), fatigue, brain fog, and sleep dysfunction that lasts for at least six months. Accumulating evidence suggests that sex and endocrine events have a significant influence on symptom onset and moderation of ME/CFS, with female sex being one of the most consistent and credible predictive risk factors associated with diagnosis. Such sex differences suggest sex chromosomes and sex steroids may play a part in the development of the condition or moderation of symptoms, although this has yet to be explored in detail.
This narrative review outlines sex differences in ME/CFS in terms of vulnerability factors and clinical phenotype and explores the known sex differences in neuroendocrine systems affected in ME/CFS and how this may relate to disease risk, onset, pathophysiology, and potential treatment avenues.
There is clear evidence of a sex dimorphism with regards to prevalence (3:1 female preponderance), clinical phenotypes, and aetiological triggers prior to symptom onset of ME/CFS. Endocrinological events, particularly those throughout the female lifespan, are associated with ME/CFS and include reproductive menstrual cycle fluctuations, pregnancy, post-partum and perimenopause. Further, there is evidence for gonadal sex, adrenal stress and renal neuroendocrine systems as implicated in ME/CFS, including changes in estrogen, progesterone compounds, aldosterone, and cortisol levels, of which there are established sex differences. The broad effects of steroid hormones on the physiological systems may also speak to the diversity of ME/CFS symptomatology observed in patients. Further attention must be paid to sex, age, and steroid biology in ME/CFS.","['Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Endocrine system', 'Estrogen', 'Hormones', 'Hypothalamus pituitary', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Sex differences']",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2022-04-15,"[{'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry &amp; Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne, Australia.

29,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,35366785,A Causal-Pathway Phenotype of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome due to Hemodialysis in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease.,"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with fatigue and physiosomatic symptoms.
The objective of this study is to delineate the associations between severity of fatigue and physio-somatic symptoms and glomerular filtration rate, inflammatory biomarkers, and Wnt/cateninpathway proteins.
The Wnt-pathway related proteins β-catenin, Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1), R-spondin- 1, and sclerostin were measured by ELISA technique in 60 ESRD patients and 30 controls. The Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (FF) Rating Scale was used to assess the severity of FF symptoms.
ESRD is characterized by a significant increase in the total FF score, muscle tension, fatigue, sadness, sleep disorders, gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms, and a flu-like malaise. The total-FF score was significantly correlated with serum levels of urea, creatinine, and copper (positively), and β-catenin, eGFR, hemoglobin, albumin, and zinc (inversely). The total-FF score was associated with the number of total dialysis and weekly dialysis sessions, and these dialysis characteristics were more important in predicting FF scores than eGFR measurements. Partial Least Squares analysis showed that the FF score comprised two factors that are differently associated with biomarkers: a) 43.0% of the variance in fatigue, GI symptoms, muscle tension, sadness, and insomnia is explained by hemoglobin, albumin, zinc, β-catenin, and R-spondin-1; and b) 22.3% of the variance in irritability, concentration and memory impairments by increased copper and cations/chloride ratio, and male sex.
ESRD patients show high levels of fatigue and physio-somatic symptoms associated with hemodialysis and mediated by dialysis-induced changes in inflammatory pathways, the Wnt/catenin pathway, and copper.","['Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome', 'biomarkers', 'inflammation', 'neuro-immune', 'oxidative stress', 'physiological stress']",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,2022-04-04,"[{'lastname': 'Asad', 'firstname': 'Halah Nori', 'initials': 'HN', 'affiliation': 'Al Najaf Health Directorate, Higher Health Institute, Najaf, Iraq.'}, {'lastname': 'Al-Hakeim', 'firstname': 'Hussein Kadhem', 'initials': 'HK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, College of Science, University of Kufa, Iraq.'}, {'lastname': 'Moustafa', 'firstname': 'Shatha Rouf', 'initials': 'SR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Analysis, College of Pharmacy, Hawler Medical University, Erbil, Iraq.'}, {'lastname': 'Maes', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria.\nSchool of Medicine, IMPACT Strategic Research Centre, Deakin University, VIC, 3220, Australia.'}]",None,"ESRD patients show high levels of fatigue and physio-somatic symptoms associated with hemodialysis and mediated by dialysis-induced changes in inflammatory pathways, the Wnt/catenin pathway, and copper.","ESRD is characterized by a significant increase in the total FF score, muscle tension, fatigue, sadness, sleep disorders, gastro-intestinal (GI) symptoms, and a flu-like malaise.

33740206",Long-Term COVID 19 Sequelae in Adolescents: the Overlap with Orthostatic Intolerance and ME/CFS.,"To discuss emerging understandings of adolescent long COVID or post-COVID-19 conditions, including proposed clinical definitions, common symptoms, epidemiology, overlaps with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and orthostatic intolerance, and preliminary guidance on management.
The recent World Health Organization clinical case definition of post-COVID-19 condition requires a history of probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptoms starting within 3 months of the onset of COVID-19. Symptoms must last for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Common symptoms of the post-COVID-19 condition include, but are not limited to, fatigue, shortness of breath, and cognitive dysfunction. These symptoms generally have an impact on everyday functioning. The incidence of prolonged symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection has proven challenging to define, but it is now clear that those with relatively mild initial infections, without severe initial respiratory disease or end-organ injury, can still develop chronic impairments, with symptoms that overlap with conditions like ME/CFS (profound fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, and orthostatic intolerance).
We do not yet have a clear understanding of the mechanisms by which individuals develop post-COVID-19 conditions. There may be several distinct types of long COVID that require different treatments. At this point, there is no single pharmacologic agent to effectively treat all symptoms. Because some presentations of post-COVID-19 conditions mimic disorders such as ME/CFS, treatment guidelines for this and related conditions can be helpful for managing post-COVID-19 symptoms.

27557649",Evaluating case diagnostic criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS): toward an empirical case definition.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by a variety of symptoms including post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and cognitive impairment. A variety of case definitions (e.g., the Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC), the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis International Consensus Criteria (ME-ICC), and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria) have been used to diagnose patients. However, these case definitions are consensus-based rather than empirical.
The aim of the current study was to evaluate the validity of the aforementioned case definitions by factor analyzing a large, international sample (
We identified seven symptom domains, including post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, and sleep dysfunction. Contrary to many existing case criteria, our analyses did not identify pain as an independent factor.
Although our results implicate a factor solution that best supports the CCC, revisions to the criteria are recommended.Implications for rehabilitationME/CFS is a chronic illness with no consensus regarding case diagnostic criteria, which creates difficulty for patients seeking assistance and disability benefits.The current study compared three commonly used case definitions for ME/CFS by factor analyzing symptomological data from an international sample of patients.Our results suggest three primary and four secondary symptom domains which differed from all three case definitions.These findings could help reduce barriers to care for those disabled with ME/CFS by guiding the development of an empirically-based case definition.","['Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome', 'case definitions', 'chronic illness', 'diagnostic criteria', 'factor analysis']",Disability and rehabilitation,2022-03-04,"[{'lastname': 'Conroy', 'firstname': 'Karl E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Islam', 'firstname': 'Mohammed F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Chicago State University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}]",None,None,"We identified seven symptom domains, including post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, and sleep dysfunction.

Accumulating data indicate a link between a redox imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation status in ME/CFS. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and selenium as effective antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents have shown potential clinical implications in chronic diseases; however, their therapeutic benefits in ME/CFS remain elusive. This open-label exploratory study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of combined CoQ10 plus selenium supplementation on clinical features and circulating biomarkers in ME/CFS. Twenty-seven ME/CFS patients received an oral combination of 400 mg of CoQ10 and 200 μg of selenium daily for 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was patient-reported changes in outcome measures from baseline to 8 weeks' postintervention. Secondary endpoint included changes in circulating biomarkers from baseline to each participant. After an 8-week intervention, a significant improvement was found for overall fatigue severity (","['biomarkers', 'cardiovascular health', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'coenzyme Q10', 'inflammation', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'redox status', 'selenium']",Antioxidants & redox signaling,2022-03-02,"[{'lastname': 'Castro-Marrero', 'firstname': 'Jesús', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""ME/CFS Research Unit, Division of Rheumatology, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Domingo', 'firstname': 'Joan Carles', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cordobilla', 'firstname': 'Begoña', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferrer', 'firstname': 'Roser', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Giralt', 'firstname': 'Marina', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Sanmartín-Sentañes', 'firstname': 'Ramon', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""ME/CFS Research Unit, Division of Rheumatology, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nME/CFS Clinical Unit, Division of Rheumatology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Alegre-Martín', 'firstname': 'Jose', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""ME/CFS Research Unit, Division of Rheumatology, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nME/CFS Clinical Unit, Division of Rheumatology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}]",None,None,None,None,10.1089/ars.2022.0018,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x1522f26b0>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,35229657,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35229657,5,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

23580077","Prevalence of Aspergillus-Derived Mycotoxins (Ochratoxin, Aflatoxin, and Gliotoxin) and Their Distribution in the Urinalysis of ME/CFS Patients.","Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a known complex, multi-organ system disorder with a sudden or subacute onset. ME/CFS occurs most commonly among women between 30 and 50 years of age. The current diagnostic criteria of ME/CFS, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, includes: profound fatigue and post-exertional malaise (>6 mo) unrelieved by rest, persistent cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance, and chronic unrefreshing sleep. Despite reported associations between ME/CFS onset and exposure to infectious agents (viral, bacterial, or fungal), the pathophysiology of ME/CFS remains unknown. In this prevalence study, we investigated the rates of Aspergillus-derived toxin levels, Aflatoxin (AF), Ochratoxin A (OTA), and Gliotoxin (GT), in the urinalysis of 236 ME/CFS patients with a history of chronic exposure to mold (i.e., from water-damaged buildings). Among ME/CFS patients reporting chronic exposure to mold, we found evidence of exposure in 92.4 percent of patients, with OTA being the most prevalent mycotoxin. Mold distributions (OTA, AF, and GT) in the urinalysis all demonstrated right skewness, while the distribution of age of ME/CFS patients diagnosed showed no deviation from normality. This study aims to provide preliminary, epidemiological evidence among ME/CFS patients who were diagnosed in South Florida with a history of exposure to mycotoxins. Based on these findings, we proposed how future control studies should approach investigating the association between chronic mold exposure and the diagnosis of ME/CFS.","['aflatoxin', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'gliotoxin', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'ochratoxin A', 'urinalysis']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2022-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Ting Yu', 'initials': 'TY', 'affiliation': 'Dr. Kiran C.

28126500","Review of the Midbrain Ascending Arousal Network Nuclei and Implications for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), Gulf War Illness (GWI) and Postexertional Malaise (PEM).","Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS and Gulf War Illness (GWI) share features of post-exertional malaise (PEM), exertional exhaustion, or postexertional symptom exacerbation. In a two-day model of PEM, submaximal exercise induced significant changes in activation of the dorsal midbrain during a high cognitive load working memory task (Washington 2020) (Baraniuk this issue). Controls had no net change. However, ME/CFS had increased activity after exercise, while GWI had significantly reduced activity indicating differential responses to exercise and pathological mechanisms. These data plus findings of the midbrain and brainstem atrophy in GWI inspired a review of the anatomy and physiology of the dorsal midbrain and isthmus nuclei in order to infer dysfunctional mechanisms that may contribute to disease pathogenesis and postexertional malaise. The nuclei of the ascending arousal network were addressed. Midbrain and isthmus nuclei participate in threat assessment, awareness, attention, mood, cognition, pain, tenderness, sleep, thermoregulation, light and sound sensitivity, orthostatic symptoms, and autonomic dysfunction and are likely to contribute to the symptoms of postexertional malaise in ME/CFS and GWI.","['anxiety', 'arousal', 'fatigue', 'inferior colliculus', 'locus coeruleus', 'midbrain reticular formation', 'parabrachial complex', 'periaqueductal gray', 'postexertional malaise', 'posttraumatic stress disorder', 'threat assessment']",Brain sciences,2022-02-26,"[{'lastname': 'Baraniuk', 'firstname': 'James N', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057, USA.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/brainsci12020132

30687207",Differential Effects of Exercise on fMRI of the Midbrain Ascending Arousal Network Nuclei in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and Gulf War Illness (GWI) in a Model of Postexertional Malaise (PEM).,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), Gulf War Illness (GWI) and control subjects underwent fMRI during difficult cognitive tests performed before and after submaximal exercise provocation (Washington 2020). Exercise caused increased activation in ME/CFS but decreased activation for GWI in the dorsal midbrain, left Rolandic operculum and right middle insula. Midbrain and isthmus nuclei participate in threat assessment, attention, cognition, mood, pain, sleep, and autonomic dysfunction.
Activated midbrain nuclei were inferred by a re-analysis of data from 31 control, 36 ME/CFS and 78 GWI subjects using a seed region approach and the Harvard Ascending Arousal Network.
Before exercise, control and GWI subjects showed greater activation during cognition than ME/CFS in the left pedunculotegmental nucleus. Post exercise, ME/CFS subjects showed greater activation than GWI ones for midline periaqueductal gray, dorsal and median raphe, and right midbrain reticular formation, parabrachial complex and locus coeruleus. The change between days (delta) was positive for ME/CFS but negative for GWI, indicating reciprocal patterns of activation. The controls had no changes.
Exercise caused the opposite effects with increased activation in ME/CFS but decreased activation in GWI, indicating different pathophysiological responses to exertion and mechanisms of disease. Midbrain and isthmus nuclei contribute to postexertional malaise in ME/CFS and GWI.","['GWI', 'Gulf War Illness', 'ME/CFS', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'PEM', 'arousal', 'autonomic', 'exercise', 'fMRI', 'midbrain', 'postexertional malaise', 'postural tachycardia']",Brain sciences,2022-01-22,"[{'lastname': 'Baraniuk', 'firstname': 'James N', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20007, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Amar', 'firstname': 'Alison', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20007, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pepermitwala', 'firstname': 'Haris', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20007, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Washington', 'firstname': 'Stuart D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20007, USA.'}]",None,None,"Before exercise, control and GWI subjects showed greater activation during cognition than ME/CFS in the left pedunculotegmental nucleus.

31364035",Post-Covid-19 Syndrome: Improvements in Health-Related Quality of Life Following Psychology-Led Interdisciplinary Virtual Rehabilitation.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasingly recognized as having significant long-term impact on physical and mental health. The Primary Care Wellbeing Service (PCWBS) in Bradford District Care NHS Foundation Trust (BDCFT) is a psychology-led specialist interdisciplinary team of health professionals specializing in persistent physical symptoms (PPS) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) with an emphasis on holistic integrated care. The PCWBS quickly recognized the risk of the long-term effects of COVID-19, particularly for social, health and care staff, and developed a 7-week virtual rehabilitation course which was piloted in October 2020.

11679412",An attempt to explain the neurological symptoms of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.,"There is accumulating evidence of endothelial dysfunction, muscle and cerebral hypoperfusion in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). In this paper we deduce the pathomechanisms resulting in central nervous pathology and the myriad of neurocognitive symptoms. We outline tentative mechanisms of impaired cerebral blood flow, increase in intracranial pressure and central adrenergic hyperactivity and how they can well explain the key symptoms of cognitive impairment, brain fog, headache, hypersensitivity, sleep disturbances and dysautonomia.","['Brain fog', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Cognitive impairment', 'Dysautonomia', 'Headache', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'Neurological symptoms', 'Post-Covid-19 syndrome', 'Sleep disturbance']",Journal of translational medicine,2021-11-24,"[{'lastname': 'Wirth', 'firstname': 'Klaus J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'KOSA Pharma GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

34192429",Clinical Heterogeneity in ME/CFS. A Way to Understand Long-COVID19 Fatigue.,"The aim of present paper is to identify clinical phenotypes in a cohort of patients affected of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Ninety-one patients and 22 healthy controls were studied with the following questionnaires, in addition to medical history: visual analogical scale for fatigue and pain, DePaul questionnaire (post-exertional malaise, immune, neuroendocrine), Pittsburgh sleep quality index, COMPASS-31 (dysautonomia), Montreal cognitive assessment, Toulouse-Piéron test (attention), Hospital Anxiety and Depression test and Karnofsky scale. Co-morbidities and drugs-intake were also recorded. A hierarchical clustering with clinical results was performed. Final study group was made up of 84 patients, mean age 44.41 ± 9.37 years (66 female/18 male) and 22 controls, mean age 45 ± 13.15 years (14 female/8 male). Patients meet diagnostic criteria of Fukuda-1994 and Carruthers-2011. Clustering analysis identify five phenotypes. Two groups without fibromyalgia were differentiated by various levels of anxiety and depression (13 and 20 patients). The other three groups present fibromyalgia plus a patient without it, but with high scores in pain scale, they were segregated by prevalence of dysautonomia (17), neuroendocrine (15), and immunological affectation (19). Regarding gender, women showed higher scores than men in cognition, pain level and depressive syndrome. Mathematical tools are a suitable approach to objectify some elusive features in order to understand the syndrome. Clustering unveils phenotypes combining fibromyalgia with varying degrees of dysautonomia, neuroendocrine or immune features and absence of fibromyalgia with high or low levels of anxiety-depression. There is no a specific phenotype for women or men.","['Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'dysautonomia', 'long COVID-19', 'post-viral fatigue']",Frontiers in psychiatry,2021-10-29,"[{'lastname': 'Murga', 'firstname': 'Iñigo', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'LaNCE-Neuropharm Group, Department of Neuroscience, University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Leioa, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Aranburu', 'firstname': 'Larraitz', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mathematics, University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Leioa, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Gargiulo', 'firstname': 'Pascual A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Lab Experimental Psychology, Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), Department of Pathology, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo (UNC), Mendoza, Argentina.'}, {'lastname': 'Gómez Esteban', 'firstname': 'Juan Carlos', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'LaNCE-Neuropharm Group, Department of Neuroscience, University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Leioa, Spain.\nNeurodegenerative Disease Group, Biocruces Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Lafuente', 'firstname': 'José-Vicente', 'initials': 'JV', 'affiliation': 'LaNCE-Neuropharm Group, Department of Neuroscience, University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU), Leioa, Spain.\nNeurodegenerative Disease Group, Biocruces Research Institute, Barakaldo, Spain.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2021 Murga, Aranburu, Gargiulo, Gómez Esteban and Lafuente.","10.3389/fpsyt.2021.735784

33537329",A Comprehensive Examination of Severely Ill ME/CFS Patients.,"One in four myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) patients are estimated to be severely affected by the disease, and these house-bound or bedbound patients are currently understudied. Here, we report a comprehensive examination of the symptoms and clinical laboratory tests of a cohort of severely ill patients and healthy controls. The greatly reduced quality of life of the patients was negatively correlated with clinical depression. The most troublesome symptoms included fatigue (85%), pain (65%), cognitive impairment (50%), orthostatic intolerance (45%), sleep disturbance (35%), post-exertional malaise (30%), and neurosensory disturbance (30%). Sleep profiles and cognitive tests revealed distinctive impairments. Lower morning cortisol level and alterations in its diurnal rhythm were observed in the patients, and antibody and antigen measurements showed no evidence for acute infections by common viral or bacterial pathogens. These results highlight the urgent need of developing molecular diagnostic tests for ME/CFS. In addition, there was a striking similarity in symptoms between long COVID and ME/CFS, suggesting that studies on the mechanism and treatment of ME/CFS may help prevent and treat long COVID and vice versa.","['antibody and antigen', 'clinical symptoms', 'cognitive tests', 'laboratory tests', 'long COVID', 'post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC)', 'quality of life', 'severe ME/CFS', 'sleep', 'viral infection']","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-10-24,"[{'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Chia-Jung', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center at Stanford, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.\nStanford Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hung', 'firstname': 'Li-Yuan', 'initials': 'LY', 'affiliation': 'ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center at Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kogelnik', 'firstname': 'Andreas M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Basis Diagnostics, Newark, CA 94560, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaufman', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center at Stanford, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aiyar', 'firstname': 'Raeka S', 'initials': 'RS', 'affiliation': 'ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center at Stanford, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.\nStanford Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chu', 'firstname': 'Angela M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center at Stanford, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.\nStanford Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilhelmy', 'firstname': 'Julie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center at Stanford, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.\nStanford Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Peng', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center at Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tannenbaum', 'firstname': 'Linda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Open Medicine Foundation, Agoura Hills, CA 91301, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Xiao', 'firstname': 'Wenzhong', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center at Stanford, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.\nStanford Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.\nME/CFS Collaborative Research Center at Harvard, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'Ronald W', 'initials': 'RW', 'affiliation': 'ME/CFS Collaborative Research Center at Stanford, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.\nStanford Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.\nDepartment of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA 94305, USA.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/healthcare9101290

32546704",Network Analysis of Symptoms Co-Occurrence in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a heterogenous disorder of multiple disabling symptoms with complex manifestations. Network analysis is a statistical and interrogative methodology to investigate the prevalence of symptoms (nodes) and their inter-dependent (inter-nodal) relationships. In the present study, we explored the co-occurrence of symptoms in a cohort of Polish CFS patients using network analysis. A total of 110 patients with CFS were examined (75 females). The mean age of the total sample was 37.93 (8.5) years old while the mean duration of symptoms in years was 4.4 (4). Post-exertional malaise (PEM) was present in 75.45% of patients, unrefreshing sleep was noted in 89.09% and impaired memory or concentration was observed in 87.27% of patients. The least prevalent symptom was tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, noted in 34.55% of the total sample. Three of the most densely connected nodes were the total number of symptoms, sore throat and PEM. PEM was positively related with impairment in memory or concentration. Both PEM and impairment in memory or concentration presence are related to more severe fatigue measured by CFQ and FIS. PEM presence was positively related with the presence of multi-joint pain and negatively with tender lymph nodes and muscle pain. Sore throat was related with objective and subjective autonomic nervous system impairment. This study helps define symptom presentation of CFS with the pathophysiology of specific systems and links with multidisciplinary contemporary molecular pathology, including comparative MRI.","['epidemiology', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'post-exertional malaise']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-10-24,"[{'lastname': 'Kujawski', 'firstname': 'Sławomir', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Exercise Physiology and Functional Anatomy, Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Słomko', 'firstname': 'Joanna', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Exercise Physiology and Functional Anatomy, Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Newton', 'firstname': 'Julia L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Population Health Sciences Institute, The Medical School, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE2 4HH, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Eaton-Fitch', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute of Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Brisbane, QLD 4222, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Brisbane, QLD 4222, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Staines', 'firstname': 'Donald R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute of Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Brisbane, QLD 4222, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Brisbane, QLD 4222, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Marshall-Gradisnik', 'firstname': 'Sonya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute of Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Brisbane, QLD 4222, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Brisbane, QLD 4222, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zalewski', 'firstname': 'Paweł', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Exercise Physiology and Functional Anatomy, Ludwik Rydygier Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland.\nNational Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute of Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Brisbane, QLD 4222, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Brisbane, QLD 4222, Australia.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/ijerph182010736

The pathomechanism, severity and progression of this illness is still being investigated. Stressors have been implicated in symptom exacerbation for ME/CFS, however, there is limited information for an Australian ME/CFS cohort. The aim of this study was to assess the potential effect of life stressors including changes in work, income, or family scenario on symptom severity in an Australian ME/CFS cohort over five months; (2) Methods: Australian residents with ME/CFS responded to questions relating to work, income, living arrangement, access to healthcare and support services as well as symptoms experienced; (3) Results: thirty-six ME/CFS patients (age: 41.25 ± 12.14) completed all questionnaires (response rate 83.7%). Muscle pain and weakness, orthostatic intolerance and intolerance to extreme temperatures were experienced and fluctuated over time. Sleep disturbances were likely to present as severe. Work and household income were associated with worsened cognitive, gastrointestinal, body pain and sleep symptoms. Increased access to healthcare services was associated with improved symptom presentation; (4) Conclusions: life stressors such as work and financial disruptions may significantly contribute to exacerbation of ME/CFS symptoms. Access to support services correlates with lower symptom scores.","['Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'family', 'income', 'life stressor', 'longitudinal', 'work']",International journal of environmental research and public health,2021-10-24,"[{'lastname': 'Balinas', 'firstname': 'Cassandra', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'The National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.\nSchool of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Eaton-Fitch', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'The National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.\nSchool of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Maksoud', 'firstname': 'Rebekah', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'The National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Staines', 'firstname': 'Donald', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'The National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Marshall-Gradisnik', 'firstname': 'Sonya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4215, Australia.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/ijerph182010614

28920037",A Comprehensive Update of the Current Understanding of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.,"This is a comprehensive literature review of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). We provide a description of the background, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management regarding CFS. CFS is a multifaceted illness that has many symptoms and a wide array of clinical presentations. As of recent, CFS has been merged with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Much of the difficulty in its management has stemmed from a lack of a concrete understanding of its etiology and pathogenesis. There is a potential association between dysfunction of the autoimmune, neuroendocrine, or autonomic nervous systems and the development of CFS. Possible triggering events, such as infections followed by an immune dysregulation resulting have also been proposed. In fact, ME/CFS was first described following Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infections, but it was later determined that it was not always preceded by EBV infection. Patient diagnosed with CFS have shown a noticeably earlier activation of anaerobic metabolism as a source of energy, which is suggestive of impaired oxygen consumption. The differential diagnoses range from tick-borne illnesses to psychiatric disorders to thyroid gland dysfunction. Given the many overlapping symptoms of CFS with other illnesses makes diagnosing it far from an easy task. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers it a diagnosing of exclusion, stating that self-reported fatigue for at minimum of six months and four of the following symptoms are necessary for a proper diagnosis: memory problems, sore throat, post-exertion malaise, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, myalgia, multi-joint pain, headaches, and troubled sleep. In turn, management of CFS is just as difficult. Treatment ranges from conservative, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressants, to minimally invasive management. Minimally invasive management involving ranscutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation of target points has demonstrated significant improvement in fatigue and associated symptoms in a 2017 randomized controlled study. The understanding of CFS is evolving before us as we continue to learn more about it. As further reliable studies are conducted, providing a better grasp of what the syndrome encompasses, we will be able to improve our diagnosis and management of it.","['Chronic Fatigue Immune Disorder', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease']",Anesthesiology and pain medicine,2021-09-21,"[{'lastname': 'Noor', 'firstname': 'Nazir', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Mount Sinai Medical Center, Department of Anesthesiology, Miami Beach, FL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Urits', 'firstname': 'Ivan', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Department of Anesthesiology, Shreveport, LA, USA.\nSouthcoast Health, Southcoast Physician Group Pain Medicine, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Degueure', 'firstname': 'Arielle', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Louisiana State University Health Shreveport School of Medicine, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rando', 'firstname': 'Lauren', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Louisiana State University Health Shreveport School of Medicine, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kata', 'firstname': 'Vijay', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Louisiana State University Health Shreveport School of Medicine, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cornett', 'firstname': 'Elyse M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Department of Anesthesiology, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaye', 'firstname': 'Alan D', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Department of Anesthesiology, Shreveport, LA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Imani', 'firstname': 'Farnad', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Pain Research Center, Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Narimani-Zamanabadi', 'firstname': 'Mahnaz', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Tehran Medical Science, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Varrassi', 'firstname': 'Giustino', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Paolo Procacci Foundation, Via Tacito 7, Roma, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Viswanath', 'firstname': 'Omar', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, Department of Anesthesiology, Shreveport, LA, USA.\nValley Anesthesiology and Pain Consultants - Envision Physician Services, Phoenix, AZ, USA.\nCreighton University School of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology, Omaha, NE, USA.\nUniversity of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix, Phoenix, AZ, USA.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2021, Author(s).","10.5812/aapm.113629

34215210",Long COVID Patient Symptoms and its Evaluation and Management.,"While the acute case burdens and deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic (in Nepal approaching 700,000 and 10,000 respectively) have been costly, the characteristics and potentially huge dimensions of the chronic disease sequelae of this infectious disease are only slowly becoming apparent. We reviewed Pub Med, major medical meeting and medical journal, and investigative journalist materials seeking to frame and describe COVID-19 chronic disease. The consequences of COVID-19 infections follow major organ damage, and induction of immunological and hormonal systems dysfunction. The first injuries are consequent to direct viral effects on tissues, and vasculitis, endothelialitis, thrombosis and inflammatory events. Pulmonary, cardiac, brain, and kidney tissues incur function-limiting damage, with dyspnea, arrythmias, decreased exercise capacity, cognitive dysfunction, and decreased glomerular filtration rates. The second process is characterized by immune dysregulation and autoimmunity, and dysfunction of hormonal regulation systems, with high, fluctuating levels of physical and mental fatigue, multiple-site pain and ache, and non-restorative sleep, in 10-30% of cases. This communication proposes evaluation and management of chronic COVID-19 patients with efficient assessment of commonest symptoms, targeted physical examination and organ function testing, and interventions based on specific organ functional status, and experience with similar chronic immune syndromes, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis.",[],JNMA; journal of the Nepal Medical Association,2021-09-12,"[{'lastname': 'Sundar Shrestha', 'firstname': 'Deepak', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Department of Internal Medicine, People's Dental College and Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal.""}, {'lastname': 'Love', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.31729/jnma.6355

32730619",COVID-19 Symptoms Over Time: Comparing Long-Haulers to ME/CFS.,"Our objective was to determine which symptoms among long-hauler COVID-19 patients change over time, and how their symptoms compare to another chronic illness group. 278 long-haulers completed two symptom questionnaires at one time point, with one recounting experiences from an average of 21.7 weeks prior.
We used a comparison group of 502 patients diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Participants completed a standardized symptom questionnaire and a list of additional CDC COVID-19 symptoms.
Over time, the long-haulers reported an overall reduction of most symptoms including unrefreshing sleep and post-exertional malaise, but an intensification of neurocognitive symptoms. When compared to ME/CFS, the COVID-19 sample was initially more symptomatic for the immune and orthostatic domains but over time, the long-haulers evidenced significantly less severe symptoms than those with ME/CFS, except in the orthostatic domain. Among the COVID-19 long haulers, several neurocognitive symptoms got worse over time, whereas improvements occurred in most other areas.
These types of differential patterns of symptoms over time might contribute to helping better understand the pathophysiology of those reporting prolonged illness following COVID-19.","['COVID-19', 'Long-Haulers', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'SARS CoV-2 virus']","Fatigue : biomedicine, health & behavior",2021-09-07,"[{'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Islam', 'firstname': 'Mohammed', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Conroy', 'firstname': 'Karl', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Cotler', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Torres', 'firstname': 'Chelsea', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Mady', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Mabie', 'firstname': 'Brianna', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}]",None,None,"Over time, the long-haulers reported an overall reduction of most symptoms including unrefreshing sleep and post-exertional malaise, but an intensification of neurocognitive symptoms.

48,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,34474739,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Cardiovascular Disease: JACC State-of-the-Art Review.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a medically unexplained illness characterized by severe fatigue limiting normal daily activities for at least 6 months accompanied by problems with unrefreshing sleep, exacerbation of symptoms following physical or mental efforts (postexertional malaise [PEM]), and either cognitive reports or physiological evidence of orthostatic intolerance in the form of either orthostatic tachycardia and/or hypocapnia. Although rarely considered to have cardiac dysfunction, ME/CFS patients frequently have reduced stroke volume with a significant inverse relation between cardiac output and PEM severity. Magnetic resonance imaging of ME/CFS patients compared with normal control subjects found significantly reduced stroke, end-systolic, and end-diastolic volumes together with reduced end-diastolic wall mass. Another cardiovascular abnormality is reduced nocturnal blood pressure assessed by 24-hour monitoring. Autonomic dysfunction is also frequently observed with postural orthostatic tachycardia and/or hypocapnia. Two consecutive cardiopulmonary stress tests may provide metabolic data substantiating PEM.","['ME/CFS', 'cardiac dysfunction', 'cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)', 'orthostatic intolerance']",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2021-09-04,"[{'lastname': 'Natelson', 'firstname': 'Benjamin H', 'initials': 'BH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Brunjes', 'firstname': 'Danielle L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.

Unfortunately, no accurate diagnostic or laboratory tests have been established, nor are any universally effective approved drugs currently available for its treatment. This study aimed to examine whether oral coenzyme Q10 and NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) co-supplementation could improve perceived fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and health-related quality of life in ME/CFS patients.

21549830","Health, Wellbeing, and Prognosis of Australian Adolescents with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS): A Case-Controlled Follow-Up Study.","The purpose of this study was to follow-up an Australian cohort of adolescents newly-diagnosed with ME/CFS at a tertiary paediatric ME/CFS clinic and healthy controls over a mean period of two years (range 1-5 years) from diagnosis. Objectives were to (a) examine changes over time in health and psychological wellbeing, (b) track ME/CFS symptomatology and fulfillment of paediatric ME/CFS diagnostic criteria over time, and (c) determine baseline predictors of ME/CFS criteria fulfilment at follow-up.
34 participants aged 13-18 years (25 ME/CFS, 23 controls) completed standardised questionnaires at diagnosis (baseline) and follow-up assessing fatigue, sleep quality and hygiene, pain, anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life. ME/CFS symptomatology and diagnostic criteria fulfilment was also recorded.
ME/CFS patients showed significant improvement in most health and psychological wellbeing domains over time, compared with controls who remained relatively stable. However, fatigue, pain, and health-related quality of life remained significantly poorer amongst ME/CFS patients compared with controls at follow-up. Sixty-five percent of ME/CFS patients at baseline continued to fulfil ME/CFS diagnostic criteria at follow-up, with pain the most frequently experienced symptom. Eighty-two percent of patients at follow-up self-reported that they still had ME/CFS, with 79% of these patients fulfilling criteria. No significant baseline predictors of ME/CFS criteria fulfilment at follow-up were observed, although pain experienced at baseline was significantly associated with criteria fulfilment at follow-up (
The majority of Australian adolescents with ME/CFS continue to fulfil diagnostic criteria at follow-up, with fatigue, pain, and health-related quality of life representing domains particularly relevant to perpetuation of ME/CFS symptoms in the early years following diagnosis. This has direct clinical impact for treating clinicians in providing a more realistic prognosis and highlighting the need for intervention with young people with ME/CFS at the initial diagnosis and start of treatment.","['adolescence', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'diagnostic criteria', 'follow-up', 'health', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'wellbeing']",Journal of clinical medicine,2021-08-28,"[{'lastname': 'Josev', 'firstname': 'Elisha K', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': ""Neurodisability and Rehabilitation, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne 3052, Australia.\nDepartment of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne 3052, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Cole', 'firstname': 'Rebecca C', 'initials': 'RC', 'affiliation': ""Neurodisability and Rehabilitation, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne 3052, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Scheinberg', 'firstname': 'Adam', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Neurodisability and Rehabilitation, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne 3052, Australia.\nDepartment of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne 3052, Australia.\nDepartment of Paediatrics, Monash University, Melbourne 3800, Australia.\nVictorian Paediatric Rehabilitation Service, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne 3052, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Rowe', 'firstname': 'Katherine', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Department of General Medicine, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne 3052, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Lubitz', 'firstname': 'Lionel', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""Department of General Medicine, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne 3052, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Knight', 'firstname': 'Sarah J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': ""Neurodisability and Rehabilitation, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne 3052, Australia.\nDepartment of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne 3052, Australia.\nVictorian Paediatric Rehabilitation Service, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne 3052, Australia.""}]",None,None,"ME/CFS patients showed significant improvement in most health and psychological wellbeing domains over time, compared with controls who remained relatively stable.

12531455",Redox imbalance links COVID-19 and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.,"Although most patients recover from acute COVID-19, some experience postacute sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (PASC). One subgroup of PASC is a syndrome called ""long COVID-19,"" reminiscent of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). ME/CFS is a debilitating condition, often triggered by viral and bacterial infections, leading to years-long debilitating symptoms including profound fatigue, postexertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive deficits, and orthostatic intolerance. Some are skeptical that either ME/CFS or long COVID-19 involves underlying biological abnormalities. However, in this review, we summarize the evidence that people with acute COVID-19 and with ME/CFS have biological abnormalities including redox imbalance, systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, an impaired ability to generate adenosine triphosphate, and a general hypometabolic state. These phenomena have not yet been well studied in people with long COVID-19, and each of them has been reported in other diseases as well, particularly neurological diseases. We also examine the bidirectional relationship between redox imbalance, inflammation, energy metabolic deficits, and a hypometabolic state. We speculate as to what may be causing these abnormalities. Thus, understanding the molecular underpinnings of both PASC and ME/CFS may lead to the development of novel therapeutics.","['COVID-19', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'mitochondria', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'redox']",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021-08-18,"[{'lastname': 'Paul', 'firstname': 'Bindu D', 'initials': 'BD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205; bpaul8@jhmi.edu ssnyder@jhmi.edu.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.\nThe Solomon H.

30311972",Exploring Symptom Fluctuations and Triggers in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Using Novel Patient-Centred N-of-1 Observational Designs: A Protocol for a Feasibility and Acceptability Study.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic condition of unknown aetiology associated with a range of disabling symptoms, including post-exertional malaise, chronic fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, orthostatic intolerance, unrefreshing sleep, and cognitive dysfunction. ME/CFS is a heterogeneous disorder, with significant variation in symptom type and severity between individuals, as well as within individuals over time. The diversity of ME/CFS symptom presentation makes management challenging; treatments supported by data from randomised controlled trials may not work for all individuals due to the variability in experienced symptoms. Studies using quantitative N-of-1 observational designs involve repeated outcome measurements in an individual over time and can generate rigorous individual-specific conclusions about symptom patterns and triggers in individuals with ME/CFS. This study aims to explore the feasibility and acceptability of using novel patient-centred N-of-1 observational designs to explore symptom fluctuations and triggers in ME/CFS at the individual level.
Individuals with a medical diagnosis of ME/CFS will be recruited through ME/CFS patient organisations to participate in a series of patient-centred N-of-1 observational studies. Using a wrist-worn electronic diary, participants will complete ecological momentary assessments of fatigue, stress, mood, and cognitive demand, three times per day for a period of 6-12 weeks. Personally relevant symptoms and triggers will also be incorporated into the questionnaire design. Physical activity will be objectively measured via an integrated accelerometer. Feasibility and acceptability outcomes will be assessed including the percentage of diary entries completed, as well as recruitment and retention rate, feasibility of analysing and interpreting the data collected, and participant views about participation elicited via a post-study semi-structured interview.
This study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of patient-centred N-of-1 observational studies to assess diseases with complex presentations such as ME/CFS, as well as provide individual-level evidence about fluctuations and triggers of ME/CFS symptoms that may aid self-management.

25912615",Patients with Persistent Polyclonal B-Cell Lymphocytosis Share the Symptomatic Criteria of Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease.,"Persistent polyclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (PPBL) is a rare and still poorly understood entity, with 90% of cases occurring in female smokers. Patients often appear tired and in pain, but the clinical symptoms remain imprecise. The main risk is the development of lymphoma in some cases. To better understand the characteristics of the fatigue associated with PPBL and study its relationship with systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), we analyzed the symptoms in a cohort of patients with PPBL included in the French national registry.
An anonymous questionnaire following the recommendations of the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine for screening of the new SEID criteria was created in French and mailed to 50 patients.
Thirty-nine (78%) contacted patients responded. The studied population was mainly constituted of women (90%) with an average age of 50 (18-59) years. Smoking was a constant factor in all patients. A total of 28/39 (72%) respondents met the SEID symptoms criteria. Severe chronic fatigue for more than 6 months was noted in 36/39 cases (92%). Unrefreshing sleep, post-exertional malaise, cognitive impairment, and orthostatic intolerance were described in 30/39 (77%), 32/39 (82%), 28/39 (72%), and 27/39 (69%) cases, respectively. Pain (arthralgia, myalgia, headache) was present in 26/39 (67%) cases. The most prominent SEID symptoms were fatigue, followed by post-exercise discomfort and cognitive difficulties. The most disabling symptom was non-restorative sleep, followed by pain. An inflammatory and/or autoimmune context was noted in 13 patients (33%), and these comorbidities could have favored the deterioration of the general condition.

The studied population was mainly constituted of women (90%) with an average age of 50 (18-59) years. Smoking was a constant factor in all patients. A total of 28/39 (72%) respondents met the SEID symptoms criteria. Severe chronic fatigue for more than 6 months was noted in 36/39 cases (92%). Unrefreshing sleep, post-exertional malaise, cognitive impairment, and orthostatic intolerance were described in 30/39 (77%), 32/39 (82%), 28/39 (72%), and 27/39 (69%) cases, respectively. Pain (arthralgia, myalgia, headache) was present in 26/39 (67%) cases. The most prominent SEID symptoms were fatigue, followed by post-exercise discomfort and cognitive difficulties. The most disabling symptom was non-restorative sleep, followed by pain. An inflammatory and/or autoimmune context was noted in 13 patients (33%), and these comorbidities could have favored the deterioration of the general condition.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used to study microstructural changes in neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we evaluated DTI parameters to investigate microstructural abnormalities in ME/CFS patients.

We explored (a) ME/CFS-like symptom prevalence and (b) whether axonal, inflammatory, and/or lung changes may contribute to ME/CFS-like symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 survivors through clinical, neuropsychiatric, neuropsychological, lung function assessment, and serum neurofilament light chain, an axonal damage biomarker. ME/CFS-like features were found in 27% of our sample. ME/CFS-like group showed worse sleep quality, fatigue, pain, depressive symptoms, subjective cognitive complaints, Borg baseline dyspnea of the 6-min walking test vs. those without ME/CFS-like symptoms. These preliminary findings raise concern on a possible future ME/CFS-like pandemic in SARS-CoV-2 survivors.","['COVID-19', 'Cognition', 'Fatigue', 'Functional neurological disorders', 'Mood alterations', 'Viral infection']",Journal of neurovirology,2021-08-04,"[{'lastname': 'Mantovani', 'firstname': 'Elisa', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Neurology Section, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. elisa.mantovani@univr.it.'}, {'lastname': 'Mariotto', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Neurology Section, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gabbiani', 'firstname': 'Daniele', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Internal Medicine Section D, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Dorelli', 'firstname': 'Gianluigi', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Internal Medicine Section D, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Bozzetti', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Neurology Section, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Federico', 'firstname': 'Angela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Neurology Section, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Zanzoni', 'firstname': 'Serena', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Centro Piattaforme Tecnologiche, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Girelli', 'firstname': 'Domenico', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Internal Medicine Section D, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Crisafulli', 'firstname': 'Ernesto', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Internal Medicine Section D, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Ferrari', 'firstname': 'Sergio', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Neurology Section, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Tamburin', 'firstname': 'Stefano', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Neurology Section, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. stefano.tamburin@univr.it.'}]",None,None,None,"© 2021.

23148306","Endothelial Senescence and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, a COVID-19 Based Hypothesis.","Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is a serious illness of unknown etiology, characterized by debilitating exhaustion, memory impairment, pain and sleep abnormalities. Viral infections are believed to initiate the pathogenesis of this syndrome although the definite proof remains elusive. With the unfolding of COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in this condition has resurfaced as excessive tiredness, a major complaint of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, often lingers for a long time, resulting in disability, and poor life quality. In a previous article, we hypothesized that COVID-19-upregulated angiotensin II triggered premature endothelial cell senescence, disrupting the intestinal and blood brain barriers. Here, we hypothesize further that post-viral sequelae, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, are promoted by the gut microbes or toxin translocation from the gastrointestinal tract into other tissues, including the brain. This model is supported by the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host proteins and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Conversely, targeting microbial translocation and cellular senescence may ameliorate the symptoms of this disabling illness.","['cellular senescence', 'endothelial cells', 'endotoxin tolerance', 'gut microbial community', 'microbial translocation']",Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2021-07-13,"[{'lastname': 'Sfera', 'firstname': 'Adonis', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Patton State Hospital, San Bernardino, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Osorio', 'firstname': 'Carolina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Zapata Martín Del Campo', 'firstname': 'Carlos M', 'initials': 'CM', 'affiliation': 'Psychiatry Service, Outpatient Consultation Department, National Institute of Cardiology Ignacio Chavez, Mexico, Mexico.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereida', 'firstname': 'Shaniah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Maurer', 'firstname': 'Steve', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Patton State Hospital, San Bernardino, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Maldonado', 'firstname': 'Jose Campo', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, Edinburg, TX, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kozlakidis', 'firstname': 'Zisis', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), Lyon, France.'}]",None,None,None,"Copyright © 2021 Sfera, Osorio, Zapata Martín del Campo, Pereida, Maurer, Maldonado and Kozlakidis.","10.3389/fncel.2021.673217

29506623","Effect of Melatonin Plus Zinc Supplementation on Fatigue Perception in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.","Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, multisystem, and profoundly debilitating condition, probably of multifactorial etiology. No effective approved drugs are currently available for its treatment. Several studies have proposed symptomatic treatment with melatonin and zinc supplementation in chronic illnesses; however, little is known about the synergistic effect of this treatment on fatigue-related symptoms in ME/CFS. The primary endpoint of the study was to assess the effect of oral melatonin plus zinc supplementation on fatigue in ME/CFS. Secondary measures included participants' sleep disturbances, anxiety/depression and health-related quality of life. A proof-of-concept, 16-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted in 50 ME/CFS patients assigned to receive either oral melatonin (1 mg) plus zinc (10 mg) supplementation (","['chronic fatigue syndrome', 'fatigue', 'melatonin', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'quality of life', 'sleep quality', 'zinc']","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-07-03,"[{'lastname': 'Castro-Marrero', 'firstname': 'Jesús', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Division of Rheumatology, ME/CFS Unit, Vall d'Hebron Hospital Research Institute, 08035 Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Zaragozá', 'firstname': 'Maria-Cleofé', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Department, Laboratorios Viñas, 08012 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'López-Vílchez', 'firstname': 'Irene', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Department, Laboratorios Viñas, 08012 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Galmés', 'firstname': 'José Luis', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Department, Laboratorios Viñas, 08012 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Cordobilla', 'firstname': 'Begoña', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Maurel', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurosciences, University of the Basque Country, 48940 Leioa, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Domingo', 'firstname': 'Joan Carles', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biomedicine, Faculty of Biology, University of Barcelona, 08028 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Alegre-Martín', 'firstname': 'José', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Division of Rheumatology, ME/CFS Unit, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, 08035 Barcelona, Spain.""}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/antiox10071010

30706234",Analysis of Gender Differences in HRV of Patients with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Using Mobile-Health Technology.,"In a previous study using mobile-health technology (mHealth), we reported a robust association between chronic fatigue symptoms and heart rate variability (HRV) in female patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). This study explores HRV analysis as an objective, non-invasive and easy-to-apply marker of ME/CFS using mHealth technology, and evaluates differential gender effects on HRV and ME/CFS core symptoms. In our methodology, participants included 77 ME/CFS patients (32 men and 45 women) and 44 age-matched healthy controls (19 men and 25 women), all self-reporting subjective scores for fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety, and depression, and neurovegetative symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. The inter-beat cardiac intervals are continuously monitored/recorded over three 5-min periods, and HRV is analyzed using a custom-made application (iOS) on a mobile device connected via Bluetooth to a wearable cardiac chest band. Male ME/CFS patients show increased scores compared with control men in all symptoms and scores of fatigue, and autonomic dysfunction, as with women in the first study. No differences in any HRV parameter appear between male ME/CFS patients and controls, in contrast to our findings in women. However, we have found negative correlations of ME/CFS symptomatology with cardiac variability (SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, LF) in men. We have also found a significant relationship between fatigue symptomatology and HRV parameters in ME/CFS patients, but not in healthy control men. Gender effects appear in HF, LF/HF, and HFnu HRV parameters. A MANOVA analysis shows differential gender effects depending on the experimental condition in autonomic dysfunction symptoms and HF and HFnu HRV parameters. A decreased HRV pattern in ME/CFS women compared to ME/CFS men may reflect a sex-related cardiac autonomic dysfunction in ME/CFS illness that could be used as a predictive marker of disease progression. In conclusion, we show that HRV analysis using mHealth technology is an objective, non-invasive tool that can be useful for clinical prediction of fatigue severity, especially in women with ME/CFS.","['HRV', 'ME/CFS', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'gender differences', 'heart rate variability', 'mHealth', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis']","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-06-03,"[{'lastname': 'Capdevila', 'firstname': 'Lluis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Departament de Psicologia Bàsica, Sport Research Institute, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Castro-Marrero', 'firstname': 'Jesús', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""ME/CFS Unit, Division of Rheumatology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08035 Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Alegre', 'firstname': 'José', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""ME/CFS Unit, Division of Rheumatology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 08035 Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Ramos-Castro', 'firstname': 'Juan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Biomedical and Electronic Instrumentation Group, Department of Electronic Engineering, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, 08034 Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Escorihuela', 'firstname': 'Rosa M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Departament de Psiquiatria i Medicina Legal, Institut de Neurociències, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Spain.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/s21113746

27217764",Systematic Review of Sleep Characteristics in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.,"(1) Background-Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multifaceted illness characterized by profound and persistent fatigue unrelieved by rest along with a range of other debilitating symptoms. Experiences of unrefreshing and disturbed sleep are frequently described by ME/CFS patients. This is the first systematic review assessing sleep characteristics in ME/CFS. The aim of this review is to determine whether there are clinical characteristics of sleep in ME/CFS patients compared to healthy controls using objective measures such as polysomnography and multiple sleep latency testing. (2) Methods-the following databases-Pubmed, Embase, Medline (EBSCO host) and Web of Science, were systematically searched for journal articles published between January 1994 to 19 February 2021. Articles that referred to polysomnography or multiple sleep latency testing and ME/CFS patients were selected, and further refined through use of specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Quality and bias were measured using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist. (3) Results-twenty observational studies were included in this review. The studies investigated objective measures of sleep quality in ME/CFS. Subjective measures including perceived sleep quality and other quality of life factors were also described. (4) Conclusions-Many of the parameters measured including slow- wave sleep, apnea- hypopnea index, spectral activity and multiple sleep latency testing were inconsistent across the studies. The available research on sleep quality in ME/CFS was also limited by recruitment decisions, confounding factors, small sample sizes and non-replicated findings. Future well-designed studies are required to understand sleep quality in ME/CFS patients.","['Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'multiple sleep latency testing', 'polysomnography', 'sleep']","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-06-03,"[{'lastname': 'Maksoud', 'firstname': 'Rebekah', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases (NCNED), Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Eaton-Fitch', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases (NCNED), Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.\nSchool of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Matula', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases (NCNED), Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cabanas', 'firstname': 'Hélène', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases (NCNED), Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Staines', 'firstname': 'Donald', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases (NCNED), Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Marshall-Gradisnik', 'firstname': 'Sonya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases (NCNED), Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast 4222, Australia.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/healthcare9050568

16763220",COVID-19 and post-infectious myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: a narrative review.,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection which can cause a variety of respiratory, gastrointestinal, and vascular symptoms. The acute illness phase generally lasts no more than 2-3 weeks. However, there is increasing evidence that a proportion of COVID-19 patients experience a prolonged convalescence and continue to have symptoms lasting several months after the initial infection. A variety of chronic symptoms have been reported including fatigue, dyspnea, myalgia, exercise intolerance, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, fever, headache, malaise, and vertigo. These symptoms are similar to those seen in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a chronic multi-system illness characterized by profound fatigue, sleep disturbances, neurocognitive changes, orthostatic intolerance, and post-exertional malaise. ME/CFS symptoms are exacerbated by exercise or stress and occur in the absence of any significant clinical or laboratory findings. The pathology of ME/CFS is not known: it is thought to be multifactorial, resulting from the dysregulation of multiple systems in response to a particular trigger. Although not exclusively considered a post-infectious entity, ME/CFS has been associated with several infectious agents including Epstein-Barr Virus, Q fever, influenza, and other coronaviruses. There are important similarities between post-acute COVID-19 symptoms and ME/CFS. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to establish COVID-19 as an infectious trigger for ME/CFS. Further research is required to determine the natural history of this condition, as well as to define risk factors, prevalence, and possible interventional strategies.","['COVID-19', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'human coronavirus', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'post-infectious fatigue', 'review']",Therapeutic advances in infectious disease,2021-05-08,"[{'lastname': 'Poenaru', 'firstname': 'Sonia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, The Ottawa Hospital, General Campus, 501 Smyth Road, Box 206, Ottawa, Ontario, K1H 8L6, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Abdallah', 'firstname': 'Sara J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Corrales-Medina', 'firstname': 'Vicente', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Cowan', 'firstname': 'Juthaporn', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Epidemiology Program, The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.'}]",None,None,None,"© The Author(s), 2021.","10.1177/20499361211009385

33248163",Three Cases of Severe ME/CFS in Adults.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, only partially understood multi-system disease whose onset and severity vary widely. Symptoms include overwhelming fatigue, post-exertional malaise, sleep disruptions, gastrointestinal issues, headaches, orthostatic intolerance, cognitive impairment, etc. ME/CFS is a physiological disease with an onset often triggered by a viral or bacterial infection, and sometimes by toxins. Some patients have a mild case and are able to function nearly on a par with healthy individuals, while others are moderately ill and still others are severely, or even, very severely ill. The cohort of moderately to very severely ill is often housebound or bedbound, has lost employment or career, and has engaged in a long, and often futile, search for treatment and relief. Here, we present three case studies, one each of a moderately ill, a severely ill, and a very severely ill person, to demonstrate the complexity of the disease, the suffering of these patients, and what health care providers can do to help.","['chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)', 'post-exertional malaise (PEM)', 'severe ME/CFS', 'very severe ME/CFS']","Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2021-03-07,"[{'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Leah R', 'initials': 'LR', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts ME/CFS & FM Association, Quincy, MA 02269, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Isaacson-Barash', 'firstname': 'Carol', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Massachusetts ME/CFS & FM Association, Quincy, MA 02269, USA.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3390/healthcare9020215

21234629",Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) and Fibromyalgia (FM): the foundation of a relationship.,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) and fibromyalgia (FM) are both debilitating syndromes with complex polysymptomatology. Early research infers that a relationship may exist even though the diagnosis provided may influence the management trajectory. In the absence of a diagnostic test and treatment, this study aims to confirm the symptoms and their severity, which may infer a relationship and influence future research.
A quasi-experimental design was utilised, using Internet-based self-assessment questionnaires focusing on nine symptom areas: criteria, pain, sleep, fatigue, anxiety and depression, health-related quality of life, self-esteem and locus of control. The questionnaires used for data collection are as follows: the American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention Symptom Inventory for CFS/ME (American CDC Symptom Inventory); the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Criteria for FM; Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ); McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ); Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI); Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); Health-Related Quality of Life SF-36 V2 (HRQoL SF-36 V2); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLOC) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES).
Participants were recruited from two distinct community groups, namely CFS/ME (n = 101) and FM (n = 107). Participants were male and female aged 17 (CFS/ME mean age 45.5 years; FM mean age 47.2 years).
All participants in the CFS/ME and FM groups satisfied the requirements of their individual criteria. Results confirmed that both groups experienced the debilitating symptoms measured, with the exception of anxiety and depression, impacting on their quality of life. Results suggest a relationship between CFS/ME and FM, indicating the requirement for future research.","['Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'chronic pain', 'fatigue', 'health-related quality of life', 'musculoskeletal pain', 'pain', 'sleep']",British journal of pain,2021-02-27,"[{'lastname': 'Mckay', 'firstname': 'Pamela G', 'initials': 'PG', 'affiliation': 'Musculoskeletal (MsK) Audit, NHS Highland, Inverness, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Colin R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Walker', 'firstname': 'Helen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Health, Nursing and Midwifery, University of the West of Scotland, Hamilton, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fleming', 'firstname': 'Mick', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Education, Sport and Culture, University College Isle of Man, Douglas.'}]","A quasi-experimental design was utilised, using Internet-based self-assessment questionnaires focusing on nine symptom areas: criteria, pain, sleep, fatigue, anxiety and depression, health-related quality of life, self-esteem and locus of control.

64,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,33529750,Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS): Where will the drugs come from?,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic debilitating disease characterized by severe and disabling fatigue that fails to improve with rest; it is commonly accompanied by multifocal pain, as well as sleep disruption, and cognitive dysfunction. Even mild exertion can exacerbate symptoms. The prevalence of ME/CFS in the U.S. is estimated to be 0.5-1.5 % and is higher among females. Viral infection is an established trigger for the onset of ME/CFS symptoms, raising the possibility of an increase in ME/CFS prevalence resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Current treatments are largely palliative and limited to alleviating symptoms and addressing the psychological sequelae associated with long-term disability. While ME/CFS is characterized by broad heterogeneity, common features include immune dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanistic basis of the disease remains poorly understood. Herein, we review the current understanding, diagnosis and treatment of ME/CFS and summarize past clinical studies aimed at identifying effective therapies. We describe the current status of mechanistic studies, including the identification of multiple targets for potential pharmacological intervention, and ongoing efforts towards the discovery of new medicines for ME/CFS treatment.","['COVID-19', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Drug discovery', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Systemic exertion intolerance disease']",Pharmacological research,2021-02-03,"[{'lastname': 'Toogood', 'firstname': 'Peter L', 'initials': 'PL', 'affiliation': 'Michigan Drug Discovery, University of Michigan, Life Science Institute, 210 Washtenaw Avenue, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States; Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan, North University Building, 428 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI, 48109, United States.

17129926",Exploratory study into the relationship between the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and fibromyalgia (FM) using a quasiexperimental design.,"To explore the relationship between symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and fibromyalgia (FM). The hypothesis predicated that there would be no significant differences between the group's symptom experience.
A quasiexperimental design. Structural equation modelling (SEM) and invariance testing.
Males (M) and females (F) >16 with a confirmed diagnosis of CFS/ME or FM by a general practitioner or specialist. CFS/ME (n=101, F: n=86, M: n=15, mean (M) age M=45.5 years). FM (n=107, F: n=95, M: n=12, M=47.2 years).
Diagnostic criteria: the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for CFS/ME and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for FM. Additional symptom questionnaires measuring: pain, sleep quality, fatigue, quality of life, anxiety and depression, locus of control and self-esteem.
Invariance was confirmed with the exception of the American CDC Symptom Inventory, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (p<0.05) based on five questions. Consequently, it was erroneous to conclude differences. Therefore, the Syndrome Model was created. SEM could not have tested the ACR previously, as it comprised a single data point. Thus, it was combined with these three questionnaires, increasing the data points, to create this new measurable model. Results confirmed no significant differences between groups (p=0.07 (p<0.05)).
Participants responded in a similar manner to the questionnaire, confirming the same symptom experience. It is important to consider this in context with differing criteria and management guidelines, as this may influence diagnosis and the trajectory of patient's management. With the biomedical cause currently unclear, it is the symptom experience and the impact on quality of life that is important. These findings are meaningful for patients, clinicians and policy development and support the requirement for future research.","['chronic fatigue syndrome', 'fibromyalgia', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'pain', 'sleep']",BMJ open,2021-02-03,"[{'lastname': 'Mckay', 'firstname': 'Pamela G', 'initials': 'PG', 'affiliation': 'Surgical Department, NHS Highland, Inverness, UK Pamela.mckay@nhs.scot.'}, {'lastname': 'Walker', 'firstname': 'Helen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Health and Life Sciences, University of the West of Scotland, Hamilton International Technology Park, Hamilton, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Colin R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Hull, Hull, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Fleming', 'firstname': 'Mick', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Education, Sport and Culture, University College Isle of Man, Douglas, Isle of Man.'}]",None,"Participants responded in a similar manner to the questionnaire, confirming the same symptom experience.

33258726",Risks for Developing Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome in College Students Following Infectious Mononucleosis: A Prospective Cohort Study.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) involves severe fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and cognitive impairment, leading to functional difficulties; prior studies have not evaluated risk factors with behavioral and immune data collected before developing ME/CFS. Up to 5% of university students develop infectious mononucleosis (IM) annually, and 9-12% meet criteria for ME/CFS 6 months later. We sought to determine predictors of ME/CFS.
We enrolled college students at the start of the school year (time 1), identified those who developed IM (time 2), and followed them for 6 months (time 3), identifying 3 groups: those who developed ME/CFS, severe ME/CFS (meeting >1 set of criteria), and who were asymptomatic. We conducted 8 behavioral and psychological surveys and analyzed cytokines at 3 time points.
238 of the 4501 students (5.3%) developed IM; 6 months later, 55 of the 238 (23%) met criteria for ME/CFS and 157 (66%) were asymptomatic. 67 of the 157 asymptomatic students served as controls. Students with severe ME/CFS were compared with students who were asymptomatic at 3 time points. The former group was not different from the latter group at time 1 (prior to developing IM) in stress, coping, anxiety, or depression but were different in several behavioral measures and had significantly lower levels of IL-6 and IL-13. At time 2 (when they developed IM), the 2 ME/CFS groups tended to have more autonomic complaints and behavioral symptoms while the severe-ME/CFS group had higher levels of IL-12 and lower levels of IL-13 than the recovered group.
At baseline, those who developed ME/CFS had more physical symptoms and immune irregularities, but not more psychological symptoms, than those who recovered.","['chronic fatigue syndrome', 'infectious mononucleosis', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis']",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2020-12-29,"[{'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cotler', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Ann and Robert H.

29762782",Deep phenotyping of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome in Japanese population.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex and debilitating disease with no molecular diagnostics and no treatment options. To identify potential markers of this illness, we profiled 48 patients and 52 controls for standard laboratory tests, plasma metabolomics, blood immuno-phenotyping and transcriptomics, and fecal microbiome analysis. Here, we identified a set of 26 potential molecular markers that distinguished ME/CFS patients from healthy controls. Monocyte number, microbiome abundance, and lipoprotein profiles appeared to be the most informative markers. When we correlated these molecular changes to sleep and cognitive measurements of fatigue, we found that lipoprotein and microbiome profiles most closely correlated with sleep disruption while a different set of markers correlated with a cognitive parameter. Sleep, lipoprotein, and microbiome changes occur early during the course of illness suggesting that these markers can be examined in a larger cohort for potential biomarker application. Our study points to a cluster of sleep-related molecular changes as a prominent feature of ME/CFS in our Japanese cohort.",[],Scientific reports,2020-11-18,"[{'lastname': 'Kitami', 'firstname': 'Toshimori', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan. toshimori.kitami@riken.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Fukuda', 'firstname': 'Sanae', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.\nKansai University of Welfare Sciences, Osaka, Japan.\nRIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Hyogo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kato', 'firstname': 'Tamotsu', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamaguti', 'firstname': 'Kouzi', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nakatomi', 'firstname': 'Yasuhito', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.\nNakatomi Fatigue Care Clinic, Osaka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamano', 'firstname': 'Emi', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.\nRIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Hyogo, Japan.\nRIKEN Compass to Healthy Life Research Complex Program, Hyogo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kataoka', 'firstname': 'Yosky', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.\nRIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Hyogo, Japan.\nRIKEN Compass to Healthy Life Research Complex Program, Hyogo, Japan.\nRIKEN Baton Zone Project, RIKEN-JEOL Collaboration Center, Hyogo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Mizuno', 'firstname': 'Kei', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.\nRIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Hyogo, Japan.\nRIKEN Compass to Healthy Life Research Complex Program, Hyogo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Tsuboi', 'firstname': 'Yuuri', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kogo', 'firstname': 'Yasushi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Preventive Medicine and Diagnosis Innovation Program, Saitama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Suzuki', 'firstname': 'Harukazu', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Itoh', 'firstname': 'Masayoshi', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Preventive Medicine and Diagnosis Innovation Program, Saitama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Morioka', 'firstname': 'Masaki Suimye', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kawaji', 'firstname': 'Hideya', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.\nRIKEN Preventive Medicine and Diagnosis Innovation Program, Saitama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Koseki', 'firstname': 'Haruhiko', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kikuchi', 'firstname': 'Jun', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.\nGraduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Aichi, Japan.\nGraduate School of Medical and Life Sciences, Yokohama City University, Kanagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hayashizaki', 'firstname': 'Yoshihide', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Preventive Medicine and Diagnosis Innovation Program, Saitama, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Ohno', 'firstname': 'Hiroshi', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Kanagawa, Japan.\nGraduate School of Medical and Life Sciences, Yokohama City University, Kanagawa, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuratsune', 'firstname': 'Hirohiko', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.\nKansai University of Welfare Sciences, Osaka, Japan.\nRIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Hyogo, Japan.\nNakatomi Fatigue Care Clinic, Osaka, Japan.\nRIKEN Compass to Healthy Life Research Complex Program, Hyogo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Watanabe', 'firstname': 'Yasuyoshi', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan. yywata@riken.jp.\nRIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, Hyogo, Japan. yywata@riken.jp.\nRIKEN Compass to Healthy Life Research Complex Program, Hyogo, Japan. yywata@riken.jp.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.1038/s41598-020-77105-y

29267236",A SWATH-MS analysis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome peripheral blood mononuclear cell proteomes reveals mitochondrial dysfunction.,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious and complex physical illness that affects all body systems with a multiplicity of symptoms, but key hallmarks of the disease are pervasive fatigue and 'post-exertional malaise', exacerbation after physical and/or mental activity of the intrinsic fatigue and other symptoms that can be highly debilitating and last from days to months. Although the disease can vary widely between individuals, common symptoms also include pain, cognitive deficits, sleep dysfunction, as well as immune, neurological and autonomic symptoms. Typically, it is a very isolating illness socially, carrying a stigma because of the lack of understanding of the cause and pathophysiology.
To gain insight into the pathophysiology of ME/CFS, we examined the proteomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by SWATH-MS analysis in a small well-characterised group of patients and matched controls. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to stratify groups based on protein abundance patterns, which clearly segregated the majority of the ME/CFS patients (9/11) from the controls. This majority subgroup of ME/CFS patients was then further compared to the control group.
A total of 60 proteins in the ME/CFS patients were differentially expressed (P < 0.01, Log
The results from this study support a model of deficient ATP production in ME/CFS, compensated for by upregulation of immediate pathways upstream of Complex V that would suggest an elevation of oxidative stress. This study and others have found evidence of a distinct pathology in ME/CFS that holds promise for developing diagnostic biomarkers.","['Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Diagnostic biomarker', 'Inflammation and immunity', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Oxidative phosphorylation', 'Oxidative stress', 'Reactive oxygen species']",Journal of translational medicine,2020-09-26,"[{'lastname': 'Sweetman', 'firstname': 'Eiren', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Kleffmann', 'firstname': 'Torsten', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Edgar', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'de Lange', 'firstname': 'Michel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Biostatistics, University of Otago, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Vallings', 'firstname': 'Rosamund', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Howick Health and Medical Centre, Auckland, 2014, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Tate', 'firstname': 'Warren', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand. warren.tate@otago.ac.nz.'}]",None,None,"A total of 60 proteins in the ME/CFS patients were differentially expressed (P < 0.01, Log",None,"10.1186/s12967-020-02533-3

22158691",Review of case definitions for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating disease with unknown causes. From the perspectives on the etiology and pathophysiology, ME/CFS has been labeled differently, which influenced changes in case definitions and terminologies. This review sought to feature aspects of the history, developments, and differential symptoms in the case definitions.
A search was conducted through PubMed published to February 2020 using the following search keywords: case definition AND chronic fatigue syndrome [MeSH Terms]. All reference lists of the included studies were checked. Of the included studies, the number of citations and the visibility in the literatures of the definitions were considered for comparisons of the criteria.
Since the first 'ME' case definition was developed in 1986, 25 case definitions/diagnostic criteria were created based on three conceptual factors (etiology, pathophysiology, and exclusionary disorders). These factors can be categorized into four categories (ME, ME/CFS, CFS, and SEID) and broadly characterized according to primary disorder (ME-viral, CFS-unknown, ME/CFS-inflammatory, SEID-multisystemic), compulsory symptoms (ME and ME/CFS-neuroinflammatory, CFS and SEID-fatigue and/or malaise), and required conditions (ME-infective agent, ME/CFS, CFS, SEID-symptoms associated with fatigue, e.g., duration of illness). ME and ME/CFS widely cover all symptom categories, while CFS mainly covers neurologic and neurocognitive symptoms. Fatigue, cognitive impairment, PEM, sleep disorder, and orthostatic intolerance were the overlapping symptoms of the 4 categories, which were included as SEID criteria.
This study comprehensively described the journey of the development of case definitions and compared the symptom criteria. This review provides broader insights and explanations to understand the complexity of ME/CFS for clinicians and researchers.","['Case definition', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Diagnostic criteria', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Systemic exertion intolerance disease']",Journal of translational medicine,2020-07-31,"[{'lastname': 'Lim', 'firstname': 'Eun-Jin', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Bioscience and Integrative Medicine, Department of Korean Medicine, Daejeon University, 62 Daehak-ro, Dong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Son', 'firstname': 'Chang-Gue', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Bioscience and Integrative Medicine, Department of Korean Medicine, Daejeon University, 62 Daehak-ro, Dong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea. ckson@dju.ac.kr.'}]",None,None,"Since the first 'ME' case definition was developed in 1986, 25 case definitions/diagnostic criteria were created based on three conceptual factors (etiology, pathophysiology, and exclusionary disorders).

23203882",Plasma proteomic profiling suggests an association between antigen driven clonal B cell expansion and ME/CFS.,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an unexplained chronic, debilitating illness characterized by fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive dysfunction, orthostatic intolerance and gastrointestinal problems. Using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), we analyzed the plasma proteomes of 39 ME/CFS patients and 41 healthy controls. Logistic regression models, with both linear and quadratic terms of the protein levels as independent variables, revealed a significant association between ME/CFS and the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) region 3-23/30. Stratifying the ME/CFS group based on self-reported irritable bowel syndrome (sr-IBS) status revealed a significant quadratic effect of immunoglobulin lambda constant region 7 on its association with ME/CFS with sr-IBS whilst IGHV3-23/30 and immunoglobulin kappa variable region 3-11 were significantly associated with ME/CFS without sr-IBS. In addition, we were able to predict ME/CFS status with a high degree of accuracy (AUC = 0.774-0.838) using a panel of proteins selected by 3 different machine learning algorithms: Lasso, Random Forests, and XGBoost. These algorithms also identified proteomic profiles that predicted the status of ME/CFS patients with sr-IBS (AUC = 0.806-0.846) and ME/CFS without sr-IBS (AUC = 0.754-0.780). Our findings are consistent with a significant association of ME/CFS with immune dysregulation and highlight the potential use of the plasma proteome as a source of biomarkers for disease.",[],PloS one,2020-07-22,"[{'lastname': 'Milivojevic', 'firstname': 'Milica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Che', 'firstname': 'Xiaoyu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, United States of America.\nDepartment of Biostatistics, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Bateman', 'firstname': 'Lucinda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Bateman Horne Center, Salt Lake City, UT, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Cheng', 'firstname': 'Aaron', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia', 'firstname': 'Benjamin A', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Hornig', 'firstname': 'Mady', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Huber', 'firstname': 'Manuel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'German Research Center for Environmental Health, Institute for Health Economics and Health Care Management, Helmholtz Zentrum München, Neuherberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimas', 'firstname': 'Nancy G', 'initials': 'NG', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Neuro Immune Medicine, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL, United States of America.\nMiami VA Medical Center, Miami, FL, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Bohyun', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Hyoungjoo', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Levine', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Levine Clinic, New York, NY, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Montoya', 'firstname': 'Jose G', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': 'Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Jack S.

Recognition of PEM is important for the diagnosis and treatment of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS).
Symptoms following cardiopulmonary exercise testing were compared between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls.
Open-ended questionnaires were provided to subjects following two maximal exercise tests, 24 hours apart. Subjects evaluated how they felt at five time points. Responses were classified into 19 symptom categories.
ME/CFS subjects (n = 49) reported an average of 14±7 symptoms compared to 4±3 by controls (n = 10). During the seven days afterwards, ME/CFS subjects reported 4±3 symptoms. None were reported by controls. Fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and sleep problems were reported with the greatest frequency. ME/CFS patients reported more symptom categories at higher frequencies than controls. The largest differences were observed in cognitive dysfunction, decrease in function, and positive feelings.
A standardized exertional stimulus produced prolonged, diverse symptoms in ME/CFS subjects. This provides clues to the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS, leading to improved diagnosis and treatment.","['ME/CFS', 'Post-exertional malaise', 'cardiopulmonary exercise test', 'symptoms']","Work (Reading, Mass.)",2020-06-23,"[{'lastname': 'Mateo', 'firstname': 'Lariel J', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'University of the Pacific, Stockton, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chu', 'firstname': 'Lily', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Independent Consultant, Burlingame, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Stevens', 'firstname': 'Staci', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Workwell Foundation, Ripon, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Stevens', 'firstname': 'Jared', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Workwell Foundation, Ripon, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Snell', 'firstname': 'Christopher R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Workwell Foundation, Ripon, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Davenport', 'firstname': 'Todd', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'University of the Pacific, Stockton, CA, USA.\nWorkwell Foundation, Ripon, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'VanNess', 'firstname': 'J Mark', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'University of the Pacific, Stockton, CA, USA.\nWorkwell Foundation, Ripon, CA, USA.'}]",None,None,"ME/CFS subjects (n = 49) reported an average of 14±7 symptoms compared to 4±3 by controls (n = 10).

This study explores risk factors for suicide among 64 individuals with ME/CFS using archival data, 17 of which died from suicide. Results indicated an increased risk of suicide for those for those utilizing the label CFS, for those with limited overall functioning, and for those without comorbid illnesses.

Observational study.
A total of 100 consecutive patients (mean age 45 years (standard deviation (SD) 9 years)) were assessed by a rehabilitation team and included in the study.
A preliminary International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) Core Set was created, based on literature studies, and on discussion forums between the team and the researchers. Patients were assessed by a rehabilitation medicine team regarding impairments in body function, activity limitations, and restrictions in participation.
Clinical assessments of the component Body Functions found impairments in energy, fatigue, physical endurance, fatigability, sleep and pain in 82-100% of patients. At least half of the patients had impairments in higher cognitive functions, attention, and emotions, as well as sound and light hypersensitivity, general hyper-reactivity and thermoregulatory functions. For the component Activity/Participation, the most frequent limitations and restrictions were in doing housework (93%), assisting others (92%), acquisition of goods and services (90%), remunerative employment (87%), handling stressful situations (83%), preparing food (83%), recreation and leisure (82%), informal socializing (78%) and carrying out daily activities (77%). The most frequent degrees of impairments/limitations/restrictions assessed were light and moderate, except for remuneative employment, for which restrictions were severe.
Using unconventional methods, this study sets out a preliminary ICF Core Set list for patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.

30296563",A systematic review of neurological impairments in myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome using neuroimaging techniques.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/ Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multi-system illness characterised by a diverse range of debilitating symptoms including autonomic and cognitive dysfunction. The pathomechanism remains elusive, however, neurological and cognitive aberrations are consistently described. This systematic review is the first to collect and appraise the literature related to the structural and functional neurological changes in ME/CFS patients as measured by neuroimaging techniques and to investigate how these changes may influence onset, symptom presentation and severity of the illness.
A systematic search of databases Pubmed, Embase, MEDLINE (via EBSCOhost) and Web of Science (via Clarivate Analytics) was performed for articles dating between December 1994 and August 2019. Included publications report on neurological differences in ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls identified using neuroimaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography and electroencephalography. Article selection was further refined based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. A quality assessment of included publications was completed using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklist.
A total of 55 studies were included in this review. All papers assessed neurological or cognitive differences in adult ME/CFS patients compared with healthy controls using neuroimaging techniques. The outcomes from the articles include changes in gray and white matter volumes, cerebral blood flow, brain structure, sleep, EEG activity, functional connectivity and cognitive function. Secondary measures including symptom severity were also reported in most studies.
The results suggest widespread disruption of the autonomic nervous system network including morphological changes, white matter abnormalities and aberrations in functional connectivity. However, these findings are not consistent across studies and the origins of these anomalies remain unknown. Future studies are required confirm the potential neurological contribution to the pathology of ME/CFS.",[],PloS one,2020-05-01,"[{'lastname': 'Maksoud', 'firstname': 'Rebekah', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'du Preez', 'firstname': 'Stanley', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nSchool of Medical Sciences, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nSchool of Medicine, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Eaton-Fitch', 'firstname': 'Natalie', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nSchool of Medical Sciences, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Thapaliya', 'firstname': 'Kiran', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Barnden', 'firstname': 'Leighton', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Cabanas', 'firstname': 'Hélène', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Staines', 'firstname': 'Donald', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Marshall-Gradisnik', 'firstname': 'Sonya', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}]",None,None,"A total of 55 studies were included in this review.

10088984",Emotional Awareness Correlated With Number of Awakenings From Polysomnography in Patients With Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome-A Pilot Study.,"Unrefreshing sleep is one of the diagnostic criteria in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), which could be explained by sleep disorders, for example obstructive sleep apnea, reported in our previous study with polysomnography. Our previous findings also indicate difficulties in emotional regulation when measuring alexithymia by TAS-20 (Toronto Alexithymia Scale) and level of emotional awareness by LEAS (Level of Emotional Awareness Scale) in ME/CFS patients. However, the reasons for this are unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate correlations between data from subjective emotional regulation and polysomnography.
Twenty-three ME/CFS patients (5 men and 18 women) of mean age 43, and 30 matched healthy controls (9 males and 21 women) of mean age 45, filled in TAS-20, LEAS, and Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale (HADS). A polysomnography was performed on patients but not on healthy controls. Thus, values of normal population were used for sleep evaluation in ME/CFS patients.
There were significant differences between patients and controls in several aspects of emotional regulation, for example LEAS-self and LEAS-total. Seventy percent of the patients had increased numbers of awakenings (shifts from any sleep stage to awake), 22% had obstructive sleep apneas, and 27% had periodic limb movements. Correlation analysis showed that number of awakenings significantly correlated with LEAS-self and LEAS-total, p < 0.01, respectively. There were no other significant correlations.
This pilot study demonstrated significant correlations between reduced emotional awareness and number of awakenings in polysomnography. Future studies with larger cohorts need to be conducted.","['alexithymia', 'awakenings', 'emotional awareness', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome', 'sleep']",Frontiers in psychiatry,2020-04-11,"[{'lastname': 'Bileviciute-Ljungar', 'firstname': 'Indre', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Danderyd University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Friberg', 'firstname': 'Danielle', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.'}]",None,This pilot study demonstrated significant correlations between reduced emotional awareness and number of awakenings in polysomnography.

30123017",Health-related quality of life in patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: an Australian cross-sectional study.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious and debilitating disorder associated with significant disruptions in daily life including. This study aimed to examine the impact of sociodemographic and patient symptom characteristics on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of Australians with ME/CFS.
Self-reported data collected from 480 individuals diagnosed with ME/CFS were obtained between August 2014 and August 2018. This cross-sectional survey analysed sociodemographic, symptom characteristics and HRQoL according to the 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36). Multivariate linear regression models were used to determine ME/CFS symptoms associated with eight domains of HRQoL.
Reported HRQoL was significantly impaired in ME/CFS patients across all domains compared with the general population. Scores were the lowest for physical role (4.11 ± 15.07) and energy/fatigue (13.54 ± 13.94). Associations with females, higher body mass index (BMI), employment status, cognitive difficulties, sensory disturbances and cardiovascular symptoms were observed in the physical functioning domain. Impaired pain domain scores were associated with high BMI, annual visits to their general practitioner, flu-like symptoms and fluctuations in body temperature. Reduced well-being scores were associated with smoking status, psychiatric comorbidity, cognitive difficulties, sleep disturbances and gastrointestinal difficulties.
This study provides evidence that ME/CFS has a profound and negative impact on HRQoL in an Australian cohort.","['Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'SF-36']","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation",2020-01-24,"[{'lastname': 'Eaton-Fitch', 'firstname': 'N', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia. ncned@griffith.edu.au.\nNational Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia. ncned@griffith.edu.au.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia. ncned@griffith.edu.au.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnston', 'firstname': 'S C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'School of Medical Science, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nNational Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Zalewski', 'firstname': 'P', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Consortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nDepartment of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Ergonomy, Uniwersytet Mikolaja Kopernika Collegium Medicum, Bydgoszcz, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Staines', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Marshall-Gradisnik', 'firstname': 'S', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.\nConsortium Health International for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia.'}]",None,This study provides evidence that ME/CFS has a profound and negative impact on HRQoL in an Australian cohort.,"Reported HRQoL was significantly impaired in ME/CFS patients across all domains compared with the general population.

28577468",Intra brainstem connectivity is impaired in chronic fatigue syndrome.,"In myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), abnormal MRI correlations with symptom severity and autonomic measures have suggested impaired nerve signal conduction within the brainstem. Here we analyse fMRI correlations to directly test connectivity within and from the brainstem. Resting and task functional MRI (fMRI) were acquired for 45 ME/CFS (Fukuda criteria) and 27 healthy controls (HC). We selected limited brainstem reticular activation system (RAS) regions-of-interest (ROIs) based on previous structural MRI findings in a different ME/CFS cohort (bilateral rostral medulla and midbrain cuneiform nucleus), the dorsal Raphe nucleus, and two subcortical ROIs (hippocampus subiculum and thalamus intralaminar nucleus) reported to have rich brainstem connections. When HC and ME/CFS were analysed separately, significant correlations were detected for both groups during both rest and task, with stronger correlations during task than rest. In ME/CFS, connections were absent between medulla and midbrain nuclei, although hippocampal connections with these nuclei were enhanced. When corresponding correlations from HC and ME/CFS were compared, ME/CFS connectivity deficits were detected within the brainstem between the medulla and cuneiform nucleus and between the brainstem and hippocampus and intralaminar thalamus, but only during task. In CFS/ME, weaker connectivity between some RAS nuclei was associated with increased symptom severity. RAS neuron oscillatory signals facilitate coherence in thalamo-cortical oscillations. Brainstem RAS connectivity deficits can explain autonomic changes and diminish cortical oscillatory coherence which can impair attention, memory, cognitive function, sleep quality and muscle tone, all symptoms of ME/CFS.","['Brainstem', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Coherent', 'Connectivity', 'Cuneiform nucleus', 'Me/cfs', 'Ras', 'Rostral medulla']",NeuroImage.

15266475",Exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome.,"A statement from the Editor in Chief about this review and its planned update is available here: https://www.cochrane.org/news/cfs
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is a serious disorder characterised by persistent postexertional fatigue and substantial symptoms related to cognitive, immune and autonomous dysfunction. There is no specific diagnostic test, therefore diagnostic criteria are used to diagnose CFS. The prevalence of CFS varies by type of diagnostic criteria used. Existing treatment strategies primarily aim to relieve symptoms and improve function. One treatment option is exercise therapy.
The objective of this review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy for adults with CFS compared with any other intervention or control on fatigue, adverse outcomes, pain, physical functioning, quality of life, mood disorders, sleep, self-perceived changes in overall health, health service resources use and dropout.
We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Group controlled trials register, CENTRAL, and SPORTDiscus up to May 2014, using a comprehensive list of free-text terms for CFS and exercise. We located unpublished and ongoing studies through the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform up to May 2014. We screened reference lists of retrieved articles and contacted experts in the field for additional studies.
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) about adults with a primary diagnosis of CFS, from all diagnostic criteria, who were able to participate in exercise therapy.
Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessments and data extraction. We combined continuous measures of outcomes using mean differences (MDs) or standardised mean differences (SMDs). To facilitate interpretation of SMDs, we re-expressed SMD estimates as MDs on more common measurement scales. We combined dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RRs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.
We included eight RCTs with data from 1518 participants.Exercise therapy lasted from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. The studies measured effect at the end of the treatment and at long-term follow-up, after 50 weeks or 72 weeks.Seven studies used aerobic exercise therapies such as walking, swimming, cycling or dancing, provided at mixed levels in terms of intensity of the aerobic exercise from very low to quite rigorous, and one study used anaerobic exercise. Control groups consisted of passive control, including treatment as usual, relaxation or flexibility (eight studies); cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (two studies); cognitive therapy (one study); supportive listening (one study); pacing (one study); pharmacological treatment (one study) and combination treatment (one study).Most studies had a low risk of selection bias. All had a high risk of performance and detection bias.Exercise therapy compared with 'passive' controlExercise therapy probably reduces fatigue at end of treatment (SMD -0.66, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.31; 7 studies, 840 participants; moderate-certainty evidence; re-expressed MD -3.4, 95% CI -5.3 to -1.6; scale 0 to 33). We are uncertain if fatigue is reduced in the long term because the certainty of the evidence is very low (SMD -0.62, 95 % CI -1.32 to 0.07; 4 studies, 670 participants; re-expressed MD -3.2, 95% CI -6.9 to 0.4; scale 0 to 33).We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions because the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; 1 study, 319 participants).Exercise therapy may moderately improve physical functioning at end of treatment, but the long-term effect is uncertain because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Exercise therapy may also slightly improve sleep at end of treatment and at long term. The effect of exercise therapy on pain, quality of life and depression is uncertain because evidence is missing or of very low certainty.Exercise therapy compared with CBTExercise therapy may make little or no difference to fatigue at end of treatment (MD 0.20, 95% CI -1.49 to 1.89; 1 study, 298 participants; low-certainty evidence), or at long-term follow-up (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.28; 2 studies, 351 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions because the certainty of the evidence is very low (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.96; 1 study, 321 participants).The available evidence suggests that there may be little or no difference between exercise therapy and CBT in physical functioning or sleep (low-certainty evidence) and probably little or no difference in the effect on depression (moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain if exercise therapy compared to CBT improves quality of life or reduces pain because the evidence is of very low certainty.Exercise therapy compared with adaptive pacingExercise therapy may slightly reduce fatigue at end of treatment (MD -2.00, 95% CI -3.57 to -0.43; scale 0 to 33; 1 study, 305 participants; low-certainty evidence) and at long-term follow-up (MD -2.50, 95% CI -4.16 to -0.84; scale 0 to 33; 1 study, 307 participants; low-certainty evidence).We are uncertain about the risk of serious adverse reactions (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.97; 1 study, 319 participants; very low-certainty evidence).The available evidence suggests that exercise therapy may slightly improve physical functioning, depression and sleep compared to adaptive pacing (low-certainty evidence). No studies reported quality of life or pain.Exercise therapy compared with antidepressantsWe are uncertain if exercise therapy, alone or in combination with antidepressants, reduces fatigue and depression more than antidepressant alone, as the certainty of the evidence is very low. The one included study did not report on adverse reactions, pain, physical functioning, quality of life, sleep or long-term results.
Exercise therapy probably has a positive effect on fatigue in adults with CFS compared to usual care or passive therapies. The evidence regarding adverse effects is uncertain. Due to limited evidence it is difficult to draw conclusions about the comparative effectiveness of CBT, adaptive pacing or other interventions. All studies were conducted with outpatients diagnosed with 1994 criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Oxford criteria, or both. Patients diagnosed using other criteria may experience different effects.",[],The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019-10-03,"[{'lastname': 'Larun', 'firstname': 'Lillebeth', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division for Health Services, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Postboks 4404 Nydalen, Oslo, Norway, N-0403.'}, {'lastname': 'Brurberg', 'firstname': 'Kjetil G', 'initials': 'KG', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Odgaard-Jensen', 'firstname': 'Jan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Price', 'firstname': 'Jonathan R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,"10.1002/14651858.CD003200.pub8

28674681",Medically Documenting Disability in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) Cases.,"Patients with severe myalgic encephalomyelitis/Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) experience debilitating physical and cognitive symptoms, which often result in the need to file disability claims. A significant number of ME/CFS patients are children or adolescents. ME/CFS patients often turn to physicians who are not trained to recognize and diagnose ME/CFS, and who might or might not understand that ME/CFS is a multi-system primarily physical illness. Such misperceptions can adversely affect the doctor-patient relationship, the clinical outcomes, as well as the results of disability claims. According to the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, ""Between 836,000 and 2.5 million Americans suffer from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome… This disease is characterized by profound fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep abnormalities, autonomic manifestations, pain, and other symptoms that are made worse by exertion of any sort. ME/CFS can severely impair patients' ability to conduct their normal lives."" The prevalence of MECFS among children and adolescents has been estimated variously as between 0.11 and 4% (1). A large percentage of children and adolescents with ME/CFS suffer from orthostatic intolerance due to one or both of these syndromes: Neurally Mediated Hypotension (NMH) and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). These elements of ME/CFS often respond well to proper treatment (2, 3).","['CFS', 'ME', 'chronic fatigue sydrome', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'physician education']",Frontiers in pediatrics,2019-07-25,"[{'lastname': 'Comerford', 'firstname': 'Barbara B', 'initials': 'BB', 'affiliation': 'Law Offices of Barbara Comerford, Paramus, NJ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Podell', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3389/fped.2019.00231

20611051",Unemployment and work disability in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis: a community-based cross-sectional study from Spain.,"Few reports have examined the association between unemployment and work disability in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). This study explored the key determinants of work disability in a CFS/ME cohort.
A community-based prospective study included 1086 CFS/ME patients aged 18-65 years. Demographic and clinical characteristics and outcome measures were recorded. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify key risk indicators of work disability.
Four hundred and fifty patients with CFS/ME were employed (41.4%) and 636 were unemployed (58.6%). Older age at pain onset (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1. 12-1.84, autonomic dysfunction (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.71-2.87), neurological symptom (OR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1. 30-2.13) and higher scores for fatigue (OR: 2.61; 95% CI: 2.01-3.39), pain (OR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.47-2.97), depression (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1. 20-3.26), psychopathology (OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.51-2.61) and sleep dysfunction (OR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1. 14-1.90) were all associated with a higher risk of work disability due to illness.
Using an explanatory approach, our findings suggest that unemployment is consistently associated with an increased risk of work disability due to CFS/ME, although further more rigorous research is now needed to help in targeting interventions at the workplace.","['Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Comorbidity', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Quality of life', 'Unemployment', 'Work disability']",BMC public health,2019-06-30,"[{'lastname': 'Castro-Marrero', 'firstname': 'Jesús', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute, Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona, Passeig de Vall d'Hebron 119-129, E-08035, Barcelona, Spain. jesus.castro@vhir.org.""}, {'lastname': 'Faro', 'firstname': 'Mónica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'EAP CAP Terrassa Nord, Consorcio Sanitario de Terrassa, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Zaragozá', 'firstname': 'María Cleofé', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute, Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona, Passeig de Vall d'Hebron 119-129, E-08035, Barcelona, Spain.\nClinical Research Department, Laboratorios Viñas, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Aliste', 'firstname': 'Luisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute, Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona, Passeig de Vall d'Hebron 119-129, E-08035, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'de Sevilla', 'firstname': 'Tomás Fernández', 'initials': 'TF', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute, Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona, Passeig de Vall d'Hebron 119-129, E-08035, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Alegre', 'firstname': 'José', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute, Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona, Passeig de Vall d'Hebron 119-129, E-08035, Barcelona, Spain.""}]",None,None,"Four hundred and fifty patients with CFS/ME were employed (41.4%) and 636 were unemployed (58.6%).

28071656",Increased risk of chronic fatigue syndrome in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a population-based retrospective cohort study.,"Similarities in the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been observed as follows: severe disease activity in IBD correlates with severe fatigue, major psychiatric signs, the common use of medication, and bacterial translocation. One of several hypotheses for explaining the mechanisms underlying CFS suggests a similarity to the impaired intestinal mucosa of IBD. ""This study investigated the risk of incident CFS among patients with IBD"".
We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study by using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to evaluate the subsequent risk of CFS in patients with IBD, according to demographic characteristics and comorbidities. The exposure cohort comprised 2163 patients with new diagnoses of IBD. Each patient was randomly selected and frequency matching according to gender and age with four participants from the general population who had no history of CFS at the index date (control cohort). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted to estimate the relationship between IBD and the subsequent risk of CFS.
The exposure cohort had a significantly higher overall risk of subsequent CFS than that of the control group [adjusted hazard ratio (Christophi in Inflamm Bowel Dis 18(12):2342-2356, 2012) = 2.25, 95%, confidence interval (Aaron and Buchwald in Ann Intern Med 134(9 Pt 2):868-881, 2001; Farraye et al. in Am J Gastroenterol 112:241, 2017) 1.70-2.99]. Further analysis indicated a significantly higher risk of CFS in patients who were male (HR = 3.23, 95% CI 2.12-4.91), were older than 35 years, and had IBD but without comorbidity status, e.g. Cancers, diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, renal disease (HR = 2.50, 95% CI 1.63-3.84) after adjustment.
The findings from this population-based retrospective cohort study suggest that IBD, especially Crohn's disease, is associated with an increased risk of subsequent CFS.","['Bacterial translocation', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)', 'Immunoinflammatory pathways', 'Inflammatory bowel disease', 'Microbiota-gut-brain interactions', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)', 'Oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) pathways']",Journal of translational medicine,2019-02-24,"[{'lastname': 'Tsai', 'firstname': 'Shin-Yi', 'initials': 'SY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. stsai22@jhu.edu.\nDepartment of Medicine, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei City, Taiwan. stsai22@jhu.edu.\nGraduate Institute of Long-Term Care, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei City, Taiwan. stsai22@jhu.edu.\nGraduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Mackay Medical College, New Taipei City, Taiwan. stsai22@jhu.edu.\nDepartment of Health Policy and Management, Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA. stsai22@jhu.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Hsuan-Ju', 'initials': 'HJ', 'affiliation': 'Management Office for Health Data, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.\nCollege of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lio', 'firstname': 'Chon-Fu', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuo', 'firstname': 'Chien-Feng', 'initials': 'CF', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Infectious Disease, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kao', 'firstname': 'An-Chun', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Wei-Shieng', 'initials': 'WS', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Infectious Disease, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yao', 'firstname': 'Wei-Cheng', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Min-Sheng General Hospital, Tao-Yuan, 330, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Chi', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Tse-Yen', 'initials': 'TY', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. hardawayoung@gmail.com.\nMolecular and Genomic Epidemiology Center, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan. hardawayoung@gmail.com.\nDivision of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan. hardawayoung@gmail.com.'}]",None,"The findings from this population-based retrospective cohort study suggest that IBD, especially Crohn's disease, is associated with an increased risk of subsequent CFS.","The exposure cohort had a significantly higher overall risk of subsequent CFS than that of the control group [adjusted hazard ratio (Christophi in Inflamm Bowel Dis 18(12):2342-2356, 2012) = 2.25, 95%, confidence interval (Aaron and Buchwald in Ann Intern Med 134(9 Pt 2):868-881, 2001; Farraye et al. in Am J Gastroenterol 112:241, 2017) 1.70-2.99].

21244747",Chronic fatigue syndrome in the emergency department.,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disease characterized by fatigue, postexertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and widespread pain. A pilot, online survey was used to determine the common presentations of CFS patients in the emergency department (ED) and attitudes about their encounters.
The anonymous survey was created to score the severity of core CFS symptoms, reasons for going to the ED, and Likert scales to grade attitudes and impressions of care. Open text fields were qualitatively categorized to determine common themes about encounters.
Fifty-nine percent of respondents with physician-diagnosed CFS (total n=282) had gone to an ED. One-third of ED presentations were consistent with orthostatic intolerance; 42% of participants were dismissed as having psychosomatic complaints. ED staff were not knowledgeable about CFS. Encounters were unfavorable (3.6 on 10-point scale). The remaining 41% of subjects did not go to ED, stating nothing could be done or they would not be taken seriously. CFS subjects can be identified by a CFS questionnaire and the prolonged presence (>6 months) of unremitting fatigue, cognitive, sleep, and postexertional malaise problems.
This is the first investigation of the presentation of CFS in the ED and indicates the importance of orthostatic intolerance as the most frequent acute cause for a visit. The self-report CFS questionnaire may be useful as a screening instrument in the ED. Education of ED staff about modern concepts of CFS is necessary to improve patient and staff satisfaction. Guidance is provided for the diagnosis and treatment of CFS in these challenging encounters.","['SEID', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'orthostatic intolerance', 'patient satisfaction', 'postexertional malaise', 'systemic exertion intolerance disease']",Open access emergency medicine : OAEM,2019-01-23,"[{'lastname': 'Timbol', 'firstname': 'Christian R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA, baraniuj@georgetown.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Baraniuk', 'firstname': 'James N', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': 'Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA, baraniuj@georgetown.edu.'}]",None,This is the first investigation of the presentation of CFS in the ED and indicates the importance of orthostatic intolerance as the most frequent acute cause for a visit.

One-third of ED presentations were consistent with orthostatic intolerance; 42% of participants were dismissed as having psychosomatic complaints. ED staff were not knowledgeable about CFS. Encounters were unfavorable (3.6 on 10-point scale). The remaining 41% of subjects did not go to ED, stating nothing could be done or they would not be taken seriously.

26075757",The DePaul Symptom Questionnaire-2: A Validation Study.,"The DePaul Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ) was developed to assess the symptomatology and case definition fulfillment of individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The questionnaire was recently revised to improve its psychometric properties, increase its diagnostic reliability, and assess symptoms required by case definitions. The resulting instrument was named the DSQ-2.
The current study sought to evaluate the utility and reliability of the new and revised items in the DSQ-2.
A cross-sectional sample of 399 adults with ME or CFS was recruited to complete the DSQ-2.
Descriptive analyses of the DSQ-2 suggest that the new and revised items enhance the instrument's ability to assess certain symptom domains and evaluate recent case definitions. Additionally, an exploratory factor analysis resulted in an eight-factor solution: post-exertional malaise, cognitive impairment, fever and flu, pain, sleep disruption, orthostatic intolerance, genitourinary issues, and temperature intolerance. The items within each factor demonstrated strong internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alphas = .73-.91).
These analyses indicate that the DSQ-2 offers a more thorough and precise understanding ME and CFS symptomology and case definition fulfillment.","['DePaul Symptom Questionnaire', 'case definitions', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'symptom assessment']","Fatigue : biomedicine, health & behavior",2019-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Bedree', 'firstname': 'Helen', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Sunnquist', 'firstname': 'Madison', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University.'}]",A cross-sectional sample of 399 adults with ME or CFS was recruited to complete the DSQ-2.,These analyses indicate that the DSQ-2 offers a more thorough and precise understanding ME and CFS symptomology and case definition fulfillment.,"Descriptive analyses of the DSQ-2 suggest that the new and revised items enhance the instrument's ability to assess certain symptom domains and evaluate recent case definitions.

20064266",Red blood cell deformability is diminished in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a poorly understood disease. Amongst others symptoms, the disease is associated with profound fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep abnormalities, and other symptoms that are made worse by physical or mental exertion. While the etiology of the disease is still debated, evidence suggests oxidative damage to immune and hematological systems as one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease. Since red blood cells (RBCs) are well-known scavengers of oxidative stress, and are critical in microvascular perfusion and tissue oxygenation, we hypothesized that RBC deformability is adversely affected in ME/CFS.
We used a custom microfluidic platform and high-speed microscopy to assess the difference in deformability of RBCs obtained from ME/CFS patients and age-matched healthy controls.
We observed from various measures of deformability that the RBCs isolated from ME/CFS patients were significantly stiffer than those from healthy controls. Our observations suggest that RBC transport through microcapillaries may explain, at least in part, the ME/CFS phenotype, and promises to be a novel first-pass diagnostic test.","['Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'cell deformability', 'microfluidics', 'red blood cells']",Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,2018-12-31,"[{'lastname': 'Saha', 'firstname': 'Amit K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, San José State University, San José, CA, USA.\nStanford Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Brendan R', 'initials': 'BR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, San José State University, San José, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilhelmy', 'firstname': 'Julie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Stanford Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Vy', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, San José State University, San José, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Abugherir', 'firstname': 'Abed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, San José State University, San José, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Do', 'firstname': 'Justin K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, San José State University, San José, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nemat-Gorgani', 'firstname': 'Mohsen', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Stanford Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'Ronald W', 'initials': 'RW', 'affiliation': 'Stanford Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramasubramanian', 'firstname': 'Anand K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, San José State University, San José, CA, USA.'}]",None,None,None,None,10.3233/CH-180469,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x15478d030>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,30594919,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30594919,30,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan
88,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,30471769,Low omega-3 index and polyunsaturated fatty acid status in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis.,"Several studies have suggested that low levels of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are associated with cardiovascular risk, major depression, sleep problems, inflammation and other health-related issues. So far, however, erythrocyte PUFA status in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) has not been established. This study aimed to determine whether n-3 PUFA content and omega-3 index are associated with measures in CFS/ME patients.
PUFA levels and omega-3 index were measured in 31 Spanish CFS/ME patients using the HS-Omega-3 Index method. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported outcome measures were also recorded.
A low mean omega-3 index (5.75%) was observed in 92.6% of the sample. Omega-3 index was inversely correlated with the AA/EPA ratio (p = 0.00002) and the BMI (p = 0.0106). In contrast, the AA/EPA ratio was positively associated with the BMI (p = 0.0038). No association for FIS-40 and PSQI measures was found (p > 0.05).
The low omega-3 index found in our CFS/ME patients may indicate increased risks for cardiovascular health, which should be further investigated. A low omega-3 index also suggests a pro-inflammatory state in these patients. Attempts should be made to increase the omega-3 index in CFS/ME patients, based on intervention trials assessing a potential therapeutic value.","['Cardiovascular health', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Inflammation', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Omega-3 index', 'Polyunsaturated fatty acids']","Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",2018-11-26,"[{'lastname': 'Castro-Marrero', 'firstname': 'Jesús', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit (Lab 145 - 1st floor), Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Vall d'Hebron Research Institute, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Passeig de Vall d'Hebron 119-129, Barcelona E-08035, Spain.

19622551",Prevalence and incidence of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome in Europe-the Euro-epiME study from the European network EUROMENE: a protocol for a systematic review.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a chronic disease involving central nervous system and immune system disorders, as well as cardiovascular abnormalities. ME/CFS is characterised by severe chronic fatigue lasting for at least 6 months, including clinical symptoms such as tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscle pain, joint pain without swelling or redness, post-exertional malaise for more than 24 hours and unrefreshing sleep. Studies on the epidemiology of ME/CFS in Europe only include single countries and, therefore, the prevalence and incidence of ME/CFS in Europe (as a whole) is unknown. One of the purposes of the European Network on ME/CFS (EUROMENE; European Union-funded COST Action; Reference number: 15111) is to address this gap in knowledge. We will systematically review the literature reporting figures from European countries to provide a robust summary and identify new challenges.
We will systematically search the literature databases Scopus, PubMed and Web of Science for studies published in the last 10 years (ie, after 2007). No language restriction will be applied. Two independent reviewers will search, screen and select studies as well as extract data about their main characteristics and evaluate their methodological and reporting quality. When disagreements emerge, the reviewers will discuss to reach a consensus. We plan to produce a narrative summary of our findings as we anticipate that studies are scarce and heterogeneous. The possibility of performing meta-analyses will be discussed in a EUROMENE meeting.
Ethical approval is not required as only publicly available data will be included. Findings will be described in EUROMENE reports, published in peer-reviewed journal(s) and presented at conferences. The findings will be also communicated to policy-makers, healthcare providers, people with ME/CFS and other sections of society through regular channels including the mass-media.

A significant percentage of ME/CFS patients remain undiagnosed, mainly due to the complexity of the disease and the lack of reliable objective biomarkers. ME/CFS patients display decreased metabolism and the severity of symptoms appears to be directly correlated to the degree of metabolic reduction that may be unique to each individual patient. However, the precise pathogenesis is still unknown, preventing the development of effective treatments. The ME/CFS phenotype has been associated with abnormalities in energy metabolism, which are apparently due to mitochondrial dysfunction in the absence of mitochondrial diseases, resulting in reduced oxidative metabolism. Such mitochondria may be further contributing to the ME/CFS symptomatology by extracellular secretion of mitochondrial DNA, which could act as an innate pathogen and create an autoinflammatory state in the hypothalamus. We propose that stimulation of hypothalamic mast cells by environmental, neuroimmune, pathogenic and stress triggers activates microglia, leading to focal inflammation in the brain and disturbed homeostasis.

26312864",Insights into myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome phenotypes through comprehensive metabolomics.,"The pathogenesis of ME/CFS, a disease characterized by fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, orthostatic intolerance, fever, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and lymphadenopathy, is poorly understood. We report biomarker discovery and topological analysis of plasma metabolomic, fecal bacterial metagenomic, and clinical data from 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls. We confirm reports of altered plasma levels of choline, carnitine and complex lipid metabolites and demonstrate that patients with ME/CFS and IBS have increased plasma levels of ceramide. Integration of fecal metagenomic and plasma metabolomic data resulted in a stronger predictive model of ME/CFS (cross-validated AUC = 0.836) than either metagenomic (cross-validated AUC = 0.745) or metabolomic (cross-validated AUC = 0.820) analysis alone. Our findings may provide insights into the pathogenesis of ME/CFS and its subtypes and suggest pathways for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",[],Scientific reports,2018-07-04,"[{'lastname': 'Nagy-Szakal', 'firstname': 'Dorottya', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, 10032, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Barupal', 'firstname': 'Dinesh K', 'initials': 'DK', 'affiliation': 'UC Davis Genome Center - Metabolomics, University of California, Davis, CA, 95616, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Bohyun', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, 10032, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Che', 'firstname': 'Xiaoyu', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, 10032, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Brent L', 'initials': 'BL', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, 10032, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kahn', 'firstname': 'Ellie J R', 'initials': 'EJR', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, 10032, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ukaigwe', 'firstname': 'Joy E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, 10032, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bateman', 'firstname': 'Lucinda', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Bateman Horne Center, Salt Lake City, UT, 84102, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimas', 'firstname': 'Nancy G', 'initials': 'NG', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Neuro Immune Medicine, College of Osteopathic Medicine, Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL, 33314, USA.\nMiami VA Medical Center, Miami, FL, 33125, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Komaroff', 'firstname': 'Anthony L', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': ""Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, 02115, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Levine', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Levine Clinic, New York, NY, 10021, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Montoya', 'firstname': 'Jose G', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': 'Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, 94305, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Peterson', 'firstname': 'Daniel L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Sierra Internal Medicine at Incline Village, Incline Village, NV, 89451, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Levin', 'firstname': 'Bruce', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biostatistics, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, 10032, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hornig', 'firstname': 'Mady', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, 10032, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fiehn', 'firstname': 'Oliver', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'UC Davis Genome Center - Metabolomics, University of California, Davis, CA, 95616, CA, USA. ofiehn@ucdavis.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Lipkin', 'firstname': 'W Ian', 'initials': 'WI', 'affiliation': 'Center for Infection and Immunity, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, New York, NY, 10032, USA. wil2001@cumc.columbia.edu.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.1038/s41598-018-28477-9

21912186",Circadian rhythm abnormalities and autonomic dysfunction in patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis.,"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) patients frequently show autonomic symptoms which may be associated with a hypothalamic dysfunction. This study aimed to explore circadian rhythm patterns in rest and activity and distal skin temperature (DST) and their association with self-reported outcome measures, in CFS/ME patients and healthy controls at two different times of year. Ten women who met both the 1994 CDC/Fukuda definition and 2003 Canadian criteria for CFS/ME were included in the study, along with ten healthy controls matched for age, sex and body mass index. Self-reported measures were used to assess fatigue, sleep quality, anxiety and depression, autonomic function and health-related quality of life. The ActTrust actigraph was used to record activity, DST and light intensity, with data intervals of one minute over seven consecutive days. Sleep variables were obtained through actigraphic analysis and from subjective sleep diary. The circadian variables and the spectral analysis of the rhythms were calculated. Linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the relationship between the rhythmic variables and clinical features. Recordings were taken in the same subjects in winter and summer. Results showed no differences in rhythm stability, sleep latency or number of awakenings between groups as measured with the actigraph. However, daily activity, the relative amplitude and the stability of the activity rhythm were lower in CFS/ME patients than in controls. DST was sensitive to environmental temperature and showed lower nocturnal values in CFS/ME patients than controls only in winter. A spectral analysis showed no differences in phase or amplitude of the 24h rhythm, but the power of the second harmonic (12h), revealed differences between groups (controls showed a post-lunch dip in activity and peak in DST, while CFS/ME patients did not) and correlated with clinical features. These findings suggest that circadian regulation and skin vasodilator responses may play a role in CFS/ME.",[],PloS one,2018-06-07,"[{'lastname': 'Cambras', 'firstname': 'Trinitat', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Chronobiology Group, Department of Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Castro-Marrero', 'firstname': 'Jesús', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Zaragoza', 'firstname': 'Maria Cleofé', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nClinical Research Department, Laboratorios Viñas, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Díez-Noguera', 'firstname': 'Antoni', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Chronobiology Group, Department of Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy and Food Sciences, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Alegre', 'firstname': 'José', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}]",None,None,None,None,"10.1371/journal.pone.0198106

24511456","Deconstructing post-exertional malaise in myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome: A patient-centered, cross-sectional survey.","Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is considered to be the hallmark characteristic of myalgic encephalomyelitis/ chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Yet, patients have rarely been asked in formal studies to describe their experience of PEM.
To describe symptoms associated with and the time course of PEM.
One hundred and fifty subjects, diagnosed via the 1994 Fukuda CFS criteria, completed a survey concerning 11 symptoms they could experience after exposure to two different types of triggers. We also inquired about onset and duration of PEM and included space for subjects to write in any additional symptoms. Results were summarized with descriptive statistics; McNemar's, paired t-, Fisher's exact and chi-square goodness-of-fit tests were used to assess for statistical significance.
One hundred and twenty-nine subjects (90%) experienced PEM with both physical and cognitive exertion and emotional distress. Almost all were affected by exertion but 14 (10%) reported no effect with emotion. Fatigue was the most commonly exacerbated symptom but cognitive difficulties, sleep disturbances, headaches, muscle pain, and flu-like feelings were cited by over 30% of subjects. Sixty percent of subjects experienced at least one inflammatory/ immune-related symptom. Subjects also cited gastrointestinal, orthostatic, mood-related, neurologic and other symptoms. Exertion precipitated significantly more symptoms than emotional distress (7±2.8 vs. 5±3.3 symptoms (median, standard deviation), p<0.001). Onset and duration of PEM varied for most subjects. However, 11% reported a consistent post-trigger delay of at least 24 hours before onset and 84% endure PEM for 24 hours or more.
This study provides exact symptom and time patterns for PEM that is generated in the course of patients' lives. PEM involves exacerbation of multiple, atypical symptoms, is occasionally delayed, and persists for extended periods. Highlighting these characteristics may improve diagnosis of ME/CFS. Incorporating them into the design of future research will accelerate our understanding of ME/CFS.",[],PloS one,2018-06-02,"[{'lastname': 'Chu', 'firstname': 'Lily', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Stanford ME/CFS Initiative, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Valencia', 'firstname': 'Ian J', 'initials': 'IJ', 'affiliation': 'Stanford ME/CFS Initiative, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Garvert', 'firstname': 'Donn W', 'initials': 'DW', 'affiliation': 'Stanford ME/CFS Initiative, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Montoya', 'firstname': 'Jose G', 'initials': 'JG', 'affiliation': 'Stanford ME/CFS Initiative, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California, United States of America.'}]",None,None,"One hundred and twenty-nine subjects (90%) experienced PEM with both physical and cognitive exertion and emotional distress.

94,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,29770505,Poor self-reported sleep quality and health-related quality of life in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis.,"Non-restorative sleep is a hallmark symptom of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. However, little is known about self-reported sleep disturbances in these subjects. This study aimed to assess the self-reported sleep quality and its impact on quality of life in a Spanish community-based chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis cohort. A prospective cross-sectional cohort study was conducted in 1,455 Spanish chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis patients. Sleep quality, fatigue, pain, functional capacity impairment, psychopathological status, anxiety/depression and health-related quality of life were assessed using validated subjective measures. The frequencies of muscular, cognitive, neurological, autonomic and immunological symptom clusters were above 80%. High scores were recorded for pain, fatigue, psychopathological status, anxiety/depression, and low scores for functional capacity and quality of life, all of which correlated significantly (all p < 0.01) with quality of sleep as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Multivariate regression analysis showed that after adjusting for age and gender, the pain intensity (odds ratio, 1.11; p <0.05), psychopathological status (odds ratio, 1.85; p < 0.001), fibromyalgia (odds ratio, 1.39; p < 0.05), severe autonomic dysfunction (odds ratio, 1.72; p < 0.05), poor functional capacity (odds ratio, 0.98; p < 0.05) and quality of life (odds ratio, 0.96; both p < 0.001) were significantly associated with poor sleep quality. These findings suggest that this large chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis sample presents poor sleep quality, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and that this poor sleep quality is associated with many aspects of quality of life.","['impaired quality of life', 'poor sleep quality', 'sleep disorders', 'unrefreshing sleep']",Journal of sleep research,2018-05-18,"[{'lastname': 'Castro-Marrero', 'firstname': 'Jesús', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Internal Medicine Service, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute (VHIR), Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Zaragozá', 'firstname': 'Maria C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Internal Medicine Service, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute (VHIR), Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nClinical Research Department, Laboratorios Viñas, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'González-Garcia', 'firstname': 'Sergio', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Internal Medicine Service, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute (VHIR), Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Aliste', 'firstname': 'Luisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Internal Medicine Service, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute (VHIR), Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Sáez-Francàs', 'firstname': 'Naia', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Psychiatry Unit, Sant Rafael Hospital (FIDMAG), Barcelona, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Romero', 'firstname': 'Odile', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': ""Sleep Unit, Clinical Neurophysiology Department, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nInstituto de Salud Carlos III, CIBER Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES), Madrid, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Ferré', 'firstname': 'Alex', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Sleep Unit, Clinical Neurophysiology Department, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.\nInstituto de Salud Carlos III, CIBER Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES), Madrid, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Fernández de Sevilla', 'firstname': 'Tomás', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Internal Medicine Service, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute (VHIR), Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}, {'lastname': 'Alegre', 'firstname': 'José', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""CFS/ME Unit, Internal Medicine Service, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital Research Institute (VHIR), Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""}]",None,None,None,© 2018 European Sleep Research Society.,10.1111/jsr.12703,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x157938630>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,29770505,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29770505,17,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

9415942",Systemic exertion intolerance disease/chronic fatigue syndrome is common in sleep centre patients with hypersomnolence: A retrospective pilot study.,"Symptoms of the central disorders of hypersomnolence extend beyond excessive daytime sleepiness to include non-restorative sleep, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. They share much in common with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, recently renamed systemic exertion intolerance disease, whose additional features include post-exertional malaise and orthostatic intolerance. We sought to determine the frequency and correlates of systemic exertion intolerance disease in a hypersomnolent population. One-hundred and eighty-seven hypersomnolent patients completed questionnaires regarding sleepiness and fatigue; questionnaires and clinical records were used to assess for systemic exertion intolerance disease. Sleep studies, hypocretin and cataplexy were additionally used to assign diagnoses of hypersomnolence disorders or sleep apnea. Included diagnoses were idiopathic hypersomnia (n = 63), narcolepsy type 2 (n = 25), persistent sleepiness after obstructive sleep apnea treatment (n = 25), short habitual sleep duration (n = 41), and sleepiness with normal sleep study (n = 33). Twenty-one percent met systemic exertion intolerance disease criteria, and the frequency of systemic exertion intolerance disease was not different across sleep diagnoses (p = .37). Patients with systemic exertion intolerance disease were no different from those without this diagnosis by gender, age, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, depressive symptoms, or sleep study parameters. The whole cohort reported substantial fatigue on questionnaires, but the systemic exertion intolerance disease group exhibited more profound fatigue and was less likely to respond to traditional wake-promoting agents (88.6% versus 67.7%, p = .01). Systemic exertion intolerance disease appears to be a common co-morbidity in patients with hypersomnolence, which is not specific to hypersomnolence subtype but may portend a poorer prognosis for treatment response.","['chronic fatigue syndrome', 'fatigue', 'idiopathic hypersomnia', 'narcolepsy', 'sleepiness', 'systemic exertion intolerance disease']",Journal of sleep research,2018-04-07,"[{'lastname': 'Maness', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Saini', 'firstname': 'Prabhjyot', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bliwise', 'firstname': 'Donald L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.\nSleep Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Olvera', 'firstname': 'Victoria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Sleep Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Rye', 'firstname': 'David B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.\nSleep Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Trotti', 'firstname': 'Lynn M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.\nSleep Center, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.'}]",None,None,None,© 2018 European Sleep Research Society.,10.1111/jsr.12689,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x1579404f0>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,29624767,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29624767,10,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

25973272",On chronic fatigue syndrome and nosological categories.,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a heterogeneous disease which presents with pronounced disabling fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment that negatively affects patients' functional capability. CFS remains a poorly defined entity and its etiology is still in question. CFS is neither a novel diagnosis nor a new medical condition. From as early as the eighteenth century, a constellation of perplexing symptoms was observed that resembled symptoms of CFS. Commencing with ""febricula"" and ending with CFS, many names for the disease were proposed including neurocirculatory asthenia, atypical poliomyelitis, Royal Free disease, effort syndrome, Akureyri disease, Tapanui disease, chronic Epstein-Barr virus syndrome, and myalgic encephalitis. To date, it remains unclear whether CFS has an autoimmune component or is a condition that precedes a full-blown autoimmune disease. Research suggests that CFS may overlap with other diseases including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA), and Sjögren's syndrome. Additionally, it has been postulated that the earliest manifestations of some autoimmune diseases can present with vague non-specific symptoms similar to CFS. Sometimes only when exposed to a secondary stimulus (e.g., antigen) which could accelerate the natural course of the disease would an individual develop the classic autoimmune disease. Due to the similarity of symptoms, it has been postulated that CFS could simply be an early manifestation of an autoimmune disease. This paper will provide a historical background review of this disease and a discussion of CFS as an entity overlapping with multiple other conditions.","['Autoimmune syndrome induced by adjuvants', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome']",Clinical rheumatology,2018-02-09,"[{'lastname': 'Sharif', 'firstname': 'Kassem', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, 5265601, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nSackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Watad', 'firstname': 'Abdulla', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, 5265601, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nSackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Bragazzi', 'firstname': 'Nicola Luigi', 'initials': 'NL', 'affiliation': 'School of Public Health, Department of Health Sciences (DISSAL), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Lichtbroun', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, 5265601, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nSackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Martini', 'firstname': 'Mariano', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Section of History of Medicine and Ethics, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Perricone', 'firstname': 'Carlo', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Sciences, Section of History of Medicine and Ethics, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.\nReumatologia, Dipartimento di Medicina Interna e Specialità Mediche, Sapienza Università di Roma, Viale del Policlinico 155, 00161, Rome, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Amital', 'firstname': 'Howard', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, 5265601, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.\nSackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.'}, {'lastname': 'Shoenfeld', 'firstname': 'Yehuda', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Zabludowicz Center for Autoimmune Diseases, Sheba Medical Center, 5265601, Tel-Hashomer, Israel. shoenfel@post.tau.ac.il.\nSackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel. shoenfel@post.tau.ac.il.'}]",None,None,None,None,10.1007/s10067-018-4009-2,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x15794fd30>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,29417255,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29417255,25,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

25417156",Open-label pilot for treatment targeting gut dysbiosis in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: neuropsychological symptoms and sex comparisons.,"Preliminary evidence suggests that the enteric microbiota may play a role in the expression of neurological symptoms in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Overlapping symptoms with the acute presentation of D-lactic acidosis has prompted the use of antibiotic treatment to target the overgrowth of species within the Streptococcus genus found in commensal enteric microbiota as a possible treatment for neurological symptoms in ME/CFS.
An open-label, repeated measures design was used to examine treatment efficacy and enable sex comparisons. Participants included 44 adult ME/CFS patients (27 females) from one specialist medical clinic with Streptococcus viable counts above 3.00 × 10
Large treatment effects were observed for the intention-to-treat sample with a reduction in Streptococcus viable count and improvement on several clinical outcomes including total symptoms, some sleep (less awakenings, greater efficiency and quality) and cognitive symptoms (attention, processing speed, cognitive flexibility, story memory and verbal fluency). Mood, fatigue and urine D:L lactate ratio remained similar across time. Ancillary results infer that shifts in microbiota were associated with more of the variance in clinical changes for males compared with females.
Results support the notion that specific microorganisms interact with some ME/CFS symptoms and offer promise for the therapeutic potential of targeting gut dysbiosis in this population. Streptococcus spp. are not the primary or sole producers of D-lactate. Further investigation of lactate concentrations are needed to elucidate any role of D-lactate in this population. Concurrent microbial shifts that may be associated with clinical improvement (i.e., increased Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium or decreased Clostridium in males) invite enquiry into alternative strategies for individualised treatment.

98,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,29348374,[Neurologic Abnormalities in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: A Review].,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by fatigue lasting for at least six months, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive impairment and orthostatic intolerance. ME/CFS has been a controversial illness because it is defined exclusively by subjective complaints. However, recent studies of neuroimaging as well as analysis of blood markers, energy metabolism and mitochondrial function have revealed many objective biological abnormalities. Specifically, it is suspected that the symptoms of ME/CFS may be triggered by immune activation - either inside or outside the brain - through release of inflammatory cytokines.

Using a range of objective and subjective measures, the aim of this study was to investigate sleep quality, the relationship between objective and subjective measures of sleep quality, and their associations with anxiety in adolescents with CFS/ME compared with healthy controls.
Twenty-one adolescents with CFS/ME aged 13 to 18 years (mean age 15.57 ± 1.40), and 145 healthy adolescents aged 13 to 18 years (mean age 16.2 ± 1.00) wore actigraphy watches continuously for 2 weeks to collect a number of objective sleep variables. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to obtain a subjective measure of sleep quality. Anxiety was measured by the Spence Children's Anxiety scale.
On average over the 2-week period, adolescents with CFS/ME were found to have (1) significantly longer objective sleep onset latency, time in bed, total sleep time, and a later rise time (all

Patients were referred to hospital for investigations and rehabilitation because of a suspected diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). The criteria for further referral to full-night polysomnography (PSG) were symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness and/or tiredness in the questionnaires.
Of a total of 381 patients, 78 (20.5%) patients underwent PSG: 66 women and 12 men, mean age 48.6 years, standard deviation ±9.9 years. On the basis of the PSG, 31 (40.3%) patients were diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea, 7 (8.9%) patients with periodic limb movement disorder, 32 (41.0%) patients with restless legs syndrome and 54 (69.3%) patients had one or more other sleep disorder. All patients were grouped into those who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS (n = 55, 70.5%) and those who did not (n = 23, 29.5%). The latter group had significantly higher respiratory (P = .01) and total arousal (P = .009) indexes and a higher oxygen desaturation index (P = .009).
More than half of these chronic fatigue patients, who also have excessive daytime sleepiness and/or tiredness, were diagnosed with sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnoea, periodic limb movement disorder and/or restless legs syndrome. Patients with such complaints should undergo polysomnography, fill in questionnaires and be offered treatment for sleep disorders before the diagnose ME/CFS is set.","['chronic fatigue syndrome', 'fatigue', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'polysomnography', 'sleep', 'sleep apnoea']",The clinical respiratory journal,2017-07-29,"[{'lastname': 'Pajediene', 'firstname': 'Evelina', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Kaunas Clinics, Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania.'}, {'lastname': 'Bileviciute-Ljungar', 'firstname': 'Indre', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.\nDepartment of Rehabilitation Medicine, Danderyd University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.\nDepartment of Medical and Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Linköping University, Pain and Rehabilitation Centre, Anaesthetics, Operations and Specialty Surgery Centre, Region Östergotland, Linköping, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Friberg', 'firstname': 'Danielle', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology (CLINTEC), Division of Otorhinolaryngology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.'}]",None,None,"Of a total of 381 patients, 78 (20.5%) patients underwent PSG: 66 women and 12 men, mean age 48.6 years, standard deviation ±9.9 years.

22931296",Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Diagnosis and Management in Young People: A Primer.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex disease that affects children and adolescents as well as adults. The etiology has not been established. While many pediatricians and other health-care providers are aware of ME/CFS, they often lack essential knowledge that is necessary for diagnosis and treatment. Many young patients experience symptoms for years before receiving a diagnosis. This primer, written by the International Writing Group for Pediatric ME/CFS, provides information necessary to understand, diagnose, and manage the symptoms of ME/CFS in children and adolescents. ME/CFS is characterized by overwhelming fatigue with a substantial loss of physical and mental stamina. Cardinal features are malaise and a worsening of symptoms following minimal physical or mental exertion. These post-exertional symptoms can persist for hours, days, or weeks and are not relieved by rest or sleep. Other symptoms include cognitive problems, unrefreshing or disturbed sleep, generalized or localized pain, lightheadedness, and additional symptoms in multiple organ systems. While some young patients can attend school, on a full or part-time basis, many others are wheelchair dependent, housebound, or bedbound. Prevalence estimates for pediatric ME/CFS vary from 0.1 to 0.5%. Because there is no diagnostic test for ME/CFS, diagnosis is purely clinical, based on the history and the exclusion of other fatiguing illnesses by physical examination and medical testing. Co-existing medical conditions including orthostatic intolerance (OI) are common. Successful management is based on determining the optimum balance of rest and activity to help prevent post-exertional symptom worsening. Medications are helpful to treat pain, insomnia, OI and other symptoms. The published literature on ME/CFS and specifically that describing the diagnosis and management of pediatric ME/CFS is very limited. Where published studies are lacking, recommendations are based on the clinical observations and practices of the authors.","['adolescent', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'diagnosis', 'joint hypermobility', 'management', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'pediatric', 'postural tachycardia syndrome']",Frontiers in pediatrics,2017-07-05,"[{'lastname': 'Rowe', 'firstname': 'Peter C', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': 'Division of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Underhill', 'firstname': 'Rosemary A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Independent Researcher, Palm Coast, FL, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Friedman', 'firstname': 'Kenneth J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'Pharmacology and Physiology, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Gurwitt', 'firstname': 'Alan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Yale Child Study Center, Harvard Medical School, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Newton Highlands, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Medow', 'firstname': 'Marvin S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwartz', 'firstname': 'Malcolm S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': 'Drexel University College of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Speight', 'firstname': 'Nigel', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Paediatrician, Durham, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Stewart', 'firstname': 'Julian M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pediatric Cardiology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Vallings', 'firstname': 'Rosamund', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Primary Care/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Clinic, Howick Health and Medical, Auckland, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Rowe', 'firstname': 'Katherine S', 'initials': 'KS', 'affiliation': ""Department of General Medicine, Royal Children's Hospital, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.""}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3389/fped.2017.00121

18805842",Prevalence of and risk factors for severe cognitive and sleep symptoms in ME/CFS and MS.,"There are considerable phenotypic and neuroimmune overlaps between myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). While the precise aetiologies of both MS and ME/CFS are unclear, evidence suggests that deterioration in cognitive function is widely prevalent in patients with either condition. Little is known about differing risk factors or exposures, which may lead to severe cognitive or sleep symptoms. This study aims to gauge the extent of cognitive and sleep symptoms in ME/CFS and MS patients participating in the UK ME/CFS Biobank and identify the characteristics of those experiencing severe symptoms.
This was a cross-sectional study of 395 UK ME/CFS Biobank participants, recruited from primary care and the community, using similar standardised protocols, and matched by age, sex and geographical area. Data were collected from participants using a standardized written questionnaire at clinical visits. Cognitive symptoms included problems with short-term memory, attention, and executive function. Sleep symptoms included unrefreshing sleep and poor quality or inadequate duration of sleep. All participants reported symptoms based on an ordinal severity scale. Multivariable logistic regression was carried out in the ME/CFS group to investigate socio-demographic factors associated with severe symptoms.
All cognitive and sleep symptoms were more prevalent in the ME/CFS group, with 'trouble concentrating' (98.3%) the most commonly reported symptom. Severe symptoms were also more commonly reported in the ME/CFS group, with 55% reporting 'severe, unrefreshing sleep'. Similarly, in the MS group, the most commonly reported severe symptoms were sleep-related. Logistic regression analysis revealed that ME/CFS patients aged over 50 years were more than three times as likely to experience severe symptoms than those younger than 30 (OR 3.23, p = 0.031). Current smoking was associated with severe symptoms, increasing the risk by approximately three times (OR 2.93, p = 0.003) and those with household incomes of more than £15,000 per year were less likely to experience severe symptoms compared to those earning less than this (OR 0.31, p = 0.017).
Cognitive and sleep symptoms are more common in ME/CFS patients than in MS patients and healthy controls, providing further support for existing evidence of central nervous system abnormalities in ME/CFS. Our findings suggest that people with ME/CFS who are smokers, or have a low income, are more likely to report severe cognitive and sleep symptoms. Future research should aim to develop strategies to prevent the progression of severe cognitive and sleep symptoms through early interventions that prioritise patients identified as being at highest risk.","['Cognitive symptoms', 'ME/CFS', 'MS', 'Risk factors', 'Severity', 'Sleep']",BMC neurology,2017-06-22,"[{'lastname': 'Jain', 'firstname': 'Vageesh', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': ""Guy's Campus, King's College London School of Medicine, London, SE1 1UL, UK. vageesh.jain@kcl.ac.uk.""}, {'lastname': 'Arunkumar', 'firstname': 'Amit', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kingdon', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, CURE-ME Team, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Disability and Eye Health Group, International Centre for Evidence in Disability (ICED, K/490, Keppel St, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Lacerda', 'firstname': 'Eliana', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, CURE-ME Team, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Disability and Eye Health Group, International Centre for Evidence in Disability (ICED, K/490, Keppel St, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Nacul', 'firstname': 'Luis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, CURE-ME Team, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Disability and Eye Health Group, International Centre for Evidence in Disability (ICED, K/490, Keppel St, London, WC1E 7HT, UK.'}]",None,None,"All cognitive and sleep symptoms were more prevalent in the ME/CFS group, with 'trouble concentrating' (98.3%) the most commonly reported symptom.

22044797",From good health to illness with post-infectious fatigue syndrome: a qualitative study of adults' experiences of the illness trajectory.,"Municipal drinking water contaminated with the parasite Giardia lamblia in Bergen, Norway, in 2004 caused an outbreak of gastrointestinal infection in 2500 people, according to the Norwegian Prescription Database. In the aftermath a minor group subsequently developed post-infectious fatigue syndrome (PIFS). Persons in this minor group had laboratory-confirmed parasites in their stool samples, and their enteritis had been cured by one or more courses of antibiotic treatment. The study's purpose was to explore how the affected persons experienced the illness trajectory and various PIFS disabilities.
A qualitative design with in-depth interviews was used to obtain first-hand experiences of PIFS. To get an overall understanding of their perceived illness trajectory, the participants were asked to retrospectively rate their functional level at different points in time. A maximum variation sample of adults diagnosed with PIFS according to the international 1994 criteria was recruited from a cohort of persons diagnosed with PIFS at a tertiary Neurology Outpatient Clinic in Western Norway. The sample comprised 19 women and seven men (mean age 41 years, range 26-59). The interviews were fully transcribed and subjected to a qualitative content analysis.
All participants had been living healthy lives pre-illness. The time to develop PIFS varied. Multiple disabilities in the physical, cognitive, emotional, neurological, sleep and intolerance domains were described. Everyone more or less dropped out from studies or work, and few needed to be taken care of during the worst period. The severity of these disabilities varied among the participants and during the illness phases. Despite individual variations, an overall pattern of illness trajectory emerged. Five phases were identified: prodromal, downward, turning, upward and chronic phase. All reached a nadir followed by varying degrees of improvement in their functional ability. None regained pre-illness health or personal and professional abilities.
The needs of persons with this condition are not met. Early diagnosis and interdisciplinary rehabilitation could be beneficial in altering the downward trajectory at an earlier stage, avoiding the most severe disability and optimising improvement. Enhanced knowledge among health professionals, tailored treatment, rest as needed, financial support and practical help would likely improve prognosis.","['Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Disability', 'In-depth interview', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Natural course', 'Patient experiences', 'Primary healthcare', 'Qualitative research']",BMC family practice,2017-03-30,"[{'lastname': 'Stormorken', 'firstname': 'Eva', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing Science, Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, P.O.B. 1130 Blindern, 0318, Oslo, Norway. eva.stormorken@medisin.uio.no.'}, {'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kirkevold', 'firstname': 'Marit', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing Science, Institute of Health and Society, University of Oslo, P.O.B. 1130 Blindern, 0318, Oslo, Norway.'}]",None,None,"All participants had been living healthy lives pre-illness.

105,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,28215232,Validation of the Flinders Fatigue Scale as a measure of daytime fatigue.,"To clinically validate the Flinders Fatigue Scale (FFS) as a brief measure of daytime fatigue, and to derive cut-off scores to classify fatigue severity.
The FFS was administered to 439 adult volunteers from the general population, 292 adults with insomnia, 132 adults with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) and 66 adults with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), together with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).
A factor analysis revealed a single factor solution for the seven-item scale (67% of total variance), although a better fit was obtained for a modified six-item version (75% of total variance). Group FFS scores varied in accordance with theorised fatigue levels, with CFS/ME and insomnia samples reporting significantly higher fatigue than OSA and volunteer samples. Good convergent validity was established with the FSS for volunteer (r = 0.67) and CFS/ME samples (r = 0.61). Excellent discriminant validity with the ESS was observed for the insomnia (r = -0.08) and CFS/ME groups (r = 0.03), while a small-to-moderate correlation was found within the volunteer sample (r = 0.29). Cut-off scores were identified to categorise borderline (13-15), moderate (16-20) and severe (≥21) fatigue.
The FFS is a reliable and valid instrument to quantify subjective daytime fatigue. Sensitivity and specificity analyses indicate scores that best discriminate insomniacs and CFS/ME populations from a non-clinical population. However, it is proposed that the data can also be used to indicate the severity of fatigue by reference to these first two groups.","['Daytime functioning', 'Fatigue', 'Insomnia', 'Psychometrics', 'Sleepiness']",Sleep medicine,2017-02-22,"[{'lastname': 'Cameron', 'firstname': 'Kate', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Flinders University, South Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Williamson', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Flinders University, South Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Short', 'firstname': 'Michelle A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Flinders University, South Australia, Australia; Centre for Sleep Research, University of South Australia, South Australia, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gradisar', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, Flinders University, South Australia, Australia.

26973799",Research Volunteers' Attitudes Toward Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis.,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) are stigmatizing illnesses characterized by cognitive difficulties, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and other symptoms. Patients are often incapacitated and stigmatized as having a psychological disorder. The Chronic Fatigue Attitudes Test (CAT) assesses stigmatizing views toward individuals with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, however, there is little research examining factors that may account for variation in stigmatizing attitudes toward this group. We examined CAT scores among college age research volunteers (N = 90), hypothesizing that exposure to information about ME and CFS as a result of volunteering on a ME and CFS-related research project would be associated with less stigmatizing attitudes compared to volunteers on unrelated projects. Findings indicated that ME and CFS research volunteers expressed less stigmatizing attitudes. Educational efforts aiming to disseminate accurate information about ME and CFS may mitigate stigma and the experience of stigma among individuals with ME and CFS.","['Attitudes', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'Stigma']",Neurology (E-Cronicon),2017-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Nehrke', 'firstname': 'Pamela I', 'initials': 'PI', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fox', 'firstname': 'Pamela A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL, USA.'}]",None,None,None,None,None,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x157a76e30>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,29662969,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29662969,0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

26147487",Poor sleep quality is associated with greater circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and severity and frequency of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) symptoms in women.,"Poor sleep quality has been linked to inflammatory processes and worse disease outcomes in the context of many chronic illnesses, but less is known in conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). This study examines the relationships between sleep quality, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and CFS/ME symptoms.
Sixty women diagnosed with CFS/ME were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) and Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-based CFS/ME symptom questionnaires. Circulating plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by ELISA. Multiple regression analyses examined associations between sleep, cytokines and symptoms, controlling for age, education, and body mass index.
Poor sleep quality (PSQI global score) was associated with greater pro-inflammatory cytokine levels: interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (β=0.258, p=0.043), IL-6 (β=0.281, p=0.033), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (β=0.263, p=0.044). Worse sleep quality related to greater fatigue severity (β=0.395, p=0.003) and fatigue-related interference with daily activities (β=0.464, p<0.001), and more severe and frequent CDC-defined core CFS/ME symptoms (β=0.499, p<0.001, and β=0.556, p<0.001, respectively).
Results underscore the importance of managing sleep-related difficulties in this patient population. Further research is needed to identify the etiology of sleep disruptions in CFS/ME and mechanistic factors linking sleep quality to symptom severity and inflammatory processes.","['Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME)', 'Fatigue', 'Inflammation', 'Poor sleep quality', 'Pro-inflammatory cytokines']",Journal of neuroimmunology,2017-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'Milrad', 'firstname': 'Sara F', 'initials': 'SF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Miami, 5665 Ponce de Leon Blvd., Miami, FL 33133, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hall', 'firstname': 'Daniel L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit St., Boston, MA 02114, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jutagir', 'firstname': 'Devika R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Miami, 5665 Ponce de Leon Blvd., Miami, FL 33133, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lattie', 'firstname': 'Emily G', 'initials': 'EG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 680 N Lake Shore Dr. Suite 1400, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ironson', 'firstname': 'Gail H', 'initials': 'GH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Miami, 5665 Ponce de Leon Blvd., Miami, FL 33133, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wohlgemuth', 'firstname': 'William', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Sleep Medicine, Miami Veteran Affairs Hospital, 1201 NW 16th St, Miami, FL 33125, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nunez', 'firstname': 'Maria Vera', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Neuro Immune Medicine, Nova Southeastern University, 8501 SW 124th Ave #111, Miami, FL 33183, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Garcia', 'firstname': 'Lina', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Miami, 1120 NW 14th St., Miami, FL 33136, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Czaja', 'firstname': 'Sara J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Miami, 1120 NW 14th St., Miami, FL 33136, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Perdomo', 'firstname': 'Dolores M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Miami, 1120 NW 14th St., Miami, FL 33136, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fletcher', 'firstname': 'Mary Ann', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Neuro Immune Medicine, Nova Southeastern University, 8501 SW 124th Ave #111, Miami, FL 33183, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Klimas', 'firstname': 'Nancy', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Neuro Immune Medicine, Nova Southeastern University, 8501 SW 124th Ave #111, Miami, FL 33183, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Antoni', 'firstname': 'Michael H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Miami, 5665 Ponce de Leon Blvd., Miami, FL 33133, USA.

24294321",Assessment of ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome): A Case Study for Health Care Providers.,"Over a million adults in the U.S. are affected by chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). A debilitating illness, ME/CFS is accompanied by profound fatigue that is not relieved by rest and affects daily activities. Symptoms include postexertional malaise, cognitive problems, unrefreshing sleep, and pain. This course provides tools to teach medical, physician assistant, and nursing students to recognize, diagnose, and manage patients with ME/CFS.
The student is expected to view the provider-to-provider video and the PowerPoint slide curriculum, which describe the steps for evaluation. The video depicts two physicians conferring about ME/CFS and addresses the challenges of making a diagnosis. The slide curriculum shows the different ME/CFS symptoms and case definitions and how to apply them using a case study. Medical, physician assistant, and nursing students were recruited to evaluate the course and viewed it either online or in a campus education center.
Results showed that students met learning objectives and showed increases from pre- to posttest evaluation in their understanding of the difficulties of diagnosing ME/CFS and managing the illness. In addition to knowledge, student attitudes towards ME/CFS changed, with more empathy towards patients and the awareness that ME/CFS requires frequent communication and reevaluation of patients' symptoms.
Strategies of how to manage ME/CFS for the patient and manage time constraints during visits with ME/CFS patients are discussed.","['Case Study', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Communication', 'Fatigue Syndrome', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis']",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,2016-12-31,"[{'lastname': 'Brimmer', 'firstname': 'Dana J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Behavioral Visiting Scientist and Contractor, Chronic Viral Diseases Branch, Centers For Disease Control And Prevention.'}, {'lastname': 'Jones', 'firstname': 'James F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': 'Guest Researcher, Chronic Viral Diseases Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.'}, {'lastname': 'Boneva', 'firstname': 'Roumiana', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiologist, Chronic Viral Diseases Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.'}, {'lastname': 'Campbell', 'firstname': 'Charlotte', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Nursing Student, University of Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Jin-Mann S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Health Statistician and Team Leader, Chronic Viral Diseases Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.'}, {'lastname': 'Unger', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth R', 'initials': 'ER', 'affiliation': 'Branch Chief, Chronic Viral Diseases Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.'}]",None,None,"Results showed that students met learning objectives and showed increases from pre- to posttest evaluation in their understanding of the difficulties of diagnosing ME/CFS and managing the illness.

8096054",Investigating unexplained fatigue in general practice with a particular focus on CFS/ME.,"Unexplained fatigue is not infrequent in the community. It presents a number of challenges to the primary care physician and particularly if the clinical examination and routine investigations are normal. However, while fatigue is a feature of many common illnesses, it is the main problem in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). This is a poorly understood condition that is accompanied by several additional symptoms which suggest a subtle multisystem dysfunction. Not infrequently it is complicated by sleep disturbance and alterations in attention, memory and mood.Specialised services for the diagnosis and management of CFS/ME are markedly deficient in the UK and indeed in virtually all countries around the world. However, unexplained fatigue and CFS/ME may be confidently diagnosed on the basis of specific clinical criteria combined with the normality of routine blood tests. The latter include those that assess inflammation, autoimmunity, endocrine dysfunction and gluten sensitivity. Early diagnosis and intervention in general practice will do much to reduce patient anxiety, encourage improvement and prevent expensive unnecessary investigations.There is presently an on-going debate as to the precise criteria that best confirms CFS/ME to the exclusion of other medical and psychiatric/psychological causes of chronic fatigue. There is also some disagreement as to best means of investigating and managing this very challenging condition. Uncertainty here can contribute to patient stress which in some individuals can perpetuate and aggravate symptoms. A simple clinical scoring system and a short list of routine investigations should help discriminate CFS/ME from other causes of continued fatigue.","['CFS/ME', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Diagnostic criteria', 'Differential diagnosis', 'Medically unexplained fatigue', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Scoring system']",BMC family practice,2016-07-21,"[{'lastname': 'Bansal', 'firstname': 'Amolak S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Immunology and Allergy, St. Helier Hospital, Carshalton, Surrey, SM5 1AA, UK.

9790480",Epidemiological characteristics of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis in Australian patients.,"No epidemiological investigations have previously been conducted in Australia according to the current clinical definitions of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME). The aim of this study was to describe sociodemographic and illness characteristics of Australian patients with CFS/ME.
A cross-sectional survey on the medical history of patients enrolled in an Australian CFS/ME research database between April 2013 and April 2015. Participants were classified according to Fukuda criteria and International Consensus Criteria.
A total of 535 patients diagnosed with CFS/ME by a primary care physician were identified. The mean age of all patients was 46.4 years (standard deviation 12.0); the majority were female (78.61%), Caucasian, and highly educated. Of these, 30.28% met Fukuda criteria. A further 31.96% met both Fukuda criteria and International Consensus Criteria. There were 14.58% reporting chronic fatigue but did not meet criteria for CFS/ME and 23.18% were considered noncases due to exclusionary conditions. Within those meeting CFS/ME criteria, the most common events prior to illness included cold or flu, gastrointestinal illness, and periods of undue stress. Of the 60 symptoms surveyed, fatigue, cognitive, and short-term memory symptoms, headaches, muscle and joint pain, unrefreshed sleep, sensory disturbances, muscle weakness, and intolerance to extremes of temperature were the most commonly occurring symptoms (reported by more than two-thirds of patients). Significant differences in symptom occurrence between Fukuda- and International Consensus Criteria-defined cases were also identified.
This is the first study to summarize sociodemographic and illness characteristics of a cohort of Australian CFS/ME patients. This is vital for identifying potential risk factors and predictors associated with CFS/ME and for guiding decisions regarding health care provision, diagnosis, and management.","['chronic fatigue', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'diagnosis', 'epidemiology', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis']",Clinical epidemiology,2016-06-10,"[{'lastname': 'Johnston', 'firstname': 'Samantha C', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Parklands, QLD, Australia; School of Medical Sciences, Griffith University, Parklands, QLD, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Staines', 'firstname': 'Donald R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Parklands, QLD, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Marshall-Gradisnik', 'firstname': 'Sonya M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Parklands, QLD, Australia; School of Medical Sciences, Griffith University, Parklands, QLD, Australia.'}]",None,"This is the first study to summarize sociodemographic and illness characteristics of a cohort of Australian CFS/ME patients.

112,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,27229907,A Systematic Review of Drug Therapies for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis.,"The pathogenesis of chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is complex and remains poorly understood. Evidence regarding the use of drug therapies in CFS/ME is currently limited and conflicting. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the existing evidence on the efficacy of drug therapies and determine whether any can be recommended for patients with CFS/ME.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched from the start of their records to March 2016 to identify relevant studies. Randomized controlled trials focusing solely on drug therapy to alleviate and/or eliminate chronic fatigue symptoms were included in the review. Any trials that considered graded exercise therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, adaptive pacing, or any other nonpharmaceutical treatment plans were excluded. The inclusion criteria were examined to ensure that study participants met specific CFS/ME diagnostic criteria. Study size, intervention, and end point outcome domains were summarized.
A total of 1039 studies were identified with the search terms; 26 studies met all the criteria and were considered suitable for review. Three different diagnostic criteria were identified: the Holmes criteria, International Consensus Criteria, and the Fukuda criteria. Primary outcomes were identified as fatigue, pain, mood, neurocognitive dysfunction and sleep quality, symptom severity, functional status, and well-being or overall health status. Twenty pharmaceutical classes were trialed. Ten medications were shown to be slightly to moderately effective in their respective study groups (P < 0.05).
These findings indicate that no universal pharmaceutical treatment can be recommended. The unknown etiology of CFS/ME, and complications arising from its heterogeneous nature, contributes to the lack of clear evidence for pharmaceutical interventions. However, patients report using a large number and variety of medications. This finding highlights the need for trials with clearly defined CFS/ME cohorts. Trials based on more specific criteria such as the International Consensus Criteria are recommended to identify specific subgroups of patients in whom treatments may be beneficial.","['chronic fatigue syndrome', 'clinical evidence', 'drug therapy', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'pharmaceutical therapy', 'treatment']",Clinical therapeutics,2016-05-28,"[{'lastname': 'Collatz', 'firstname': 'Ansel', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Neuroimmunology and Emerging Diseases, Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, QLD, Australia; School of Medical Sciences, Griffith University, Gold Coast, QLD, Australia.

10527290",Housebound versus nonhousebound patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome.,"The objective of this study was to examine individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome who are confined to their homes due to severe symptomatology. The existing literature fails to address differences between this group, and less severe, nonhousebound patient populations.
Participants completed the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire, a measure of myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome symptomology, and the SF-36, a measure of health impact on physical/mental functioning. ANOVAs and, where appropriate, MANCOVAS were used to compare housebound and nonhousebound patients with myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome across areas of functioning, symptomatology, and illness onset characteristics.
Findings indicated that the housebound group represented one quarter of the sample, and were significantly more impaired with regards to physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, fatigue, postexertional malaise, sleep, pain, neurocognitive, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune functioning compared to individuals who were not housebound.
Findings indicated that housebound patients have more impairment on functional and symptom outcomes compared to those who were not housebound. Understanding the differences between housebound and not housebound groups holds implications for physicians and researchers as they develop interventions intended for patients who are most severely affected by this chronic illness.","['Chronic illness', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'housebound', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'severely ill']",Chronic illness,2016-04-30,"[{'lastname': 'Pendergrast', 'firstname': 'Tricia', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, USA tpender1@depaul.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Abigail', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sunnquist', 'firstname': 'Madison', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jantke', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Newton', 'firstname': 'Julia L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Newcastle University, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Strand', 'firstname': 'Elin Bolle', 'initials': 'EB', 'affiliation': 'Oslo University Hospital, Norway.'}, {'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, USA.'}]",None,None,"Findings indicated that the housebound group represented one quarter of the sample, and were significantly more impaired with regards to physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, fatigue, postexertional malaise, sleep, pain, neurocognitive, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune functioning compared to individuals who were not housebound.",© The Author(s) 2016.,10.1177/1742395316644770,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x157b08180>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,27127189,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27127189,59,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

10911826",Case definitions integrating empiric and consensus perspectives.,"There has been considerable controversy regarding how to name and define the illnesses known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The IOM report has proposed a new clinical criteria and name for this illness, but aspects of these recommendations have been scrutinized by patients and scientists.
It is possible that both empiric and consensus approaches could be used to help settle some of these diagnostic challenges. Using patient samples collected in the United States, Great Britain, and Norway (N=556), the current study attempted to categorize patients using more general as well as more restricted case definitions.
Overall, the outcomes suggest that there might be four groupings of patients, with the broadest category involving those with chronic fatigue (N=62), defined by 6 or more months of fatigue which can be cannot be explained by medical or psychiatric conditions. A second category involves those patients that have chronic fatigue that can be explained by a medical or psychiatric condition (N=47). A third category involves more specific criteria that have been posited both by the IOM report, a Canadian Clinical Case criteria, a ME-ICC criteria and a more empiric approach. These efforts have specified domains of substantial reductions of activity, post-exertional malaise, neurocognitive impairment, and sleep dysfunction (N=346). Patients with these characteristics were more functionally impaired than those meeting just chronic fatigue criteria, 
The advantages of using such empirical and consensus approaches to develop reliable classification and diagnostic efforts are discussed.","['case definition', 'chronic fatigue syndrome', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis']","Fatigue : biomedicine, health & behavior",2016-04-19,"[{'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL USA.'}, {'lastname': 'McManimen', 'firstname': 'Stephanie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sunnquist', 'firstname': 'Madison', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Abigail', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Furst', 'firstname': 'Jacob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Newton', 'firstname': 'Julia L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Newcastle University.'}, {'lastname': 'Strand', 'firstname': 'Elin Bolle', 'initials': 'EB', 'affiliation': 'Oslo University Hospital.'}]",None,None,"Overall, the outcomes suggest that there might be four groupings of patients, with the broadest category involving those with chronic fatigue (N=62), defined by 6 or more months of fatigue which can be cannot be explained by medical or psychiatric conditions.

116,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,26804593,The role of the hippocampus in the pathogenesis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS).,"Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a severe acquired illness characterized by a profound sensation of fatigue, not ameliorated by rest and resulting in a substantial decrease in the amount and quality of occupational, social and recreational activities. Despite intense research, the aetiology and pathogenesis of ME/CFS is still unknown and no conclusive biological markers have been found. As a consequence, an accepted curative treatment is still lacking and rehabilitation programmes are not very effective, as few patients recover. Increased knowledge of the mechanisms leading to the emergence and maintenance of the illness is called for. In this study, I will put forth an alternative hypothesis to explain some of the pathologies associated with ME/CFS, by concentrating on one of the major strategic organs of the brain, the hippocampus. I will show that the ME/CFS triggering factors also impact the hippocampus, leading to neurocognitive deficits and disturbances in the regulation of the stress system and pain perception. These deficits lead to a substantial decrease in activity and to sleep disorders, which, in turn, impact the hippocampus and initiate a vicious circle of increased disability.",[],Medical hypotheses,2016-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Saury', 'firstname': 'Jean-Michel', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'ME/CFS Rehabilitation Unit, Rehabilitation Clinic, Danderyd University Hospital, SE-18288 Stockholm, Sweden.

24909808",Changes in Gut and Plasma Microbiome following Exercise Challenge in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS).,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a disease characterized by intense and debilitating fatigue not due to physical activity that has persisted for at least 6 months, post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and accompanied by a number of secondary symptoms, including sore throat, memory and concentration impairment, headache, and muscle/joint pain. In patients with post-exertional malaise, significant worsening of symptoms occurs following physical exertion and exercise challenge serves as a useful method for identifying biomarkers for exertion intolerance. Evidence suggests that intestinal dysbiosis and systemic responses to gut microorganisms may play a role in the symptomology of ME/CFS. As such, we hypothesized that post-exertion worsening of ME/CFS symptoms could be due to increased bacterial translocation from the intestine into the systemic circulation. To test this hypothesis, we collected symptom reports and blood and stool samples from ten clinically characterized ME/CFS patients and ten matched healthy controls before and 15 minutes, 48 hours, and 72 hours after a maximal exercise challenge. Microbiomes of blood and stool samples were examined. Stool sample microbiomes differed between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls in the abundance of several major bacterial phyla. Following maximal exercise challenge, there was an increase in relative abundance of 6 of the 9 major bacterial phyla/genera in ME/CFS patients from baseline to 72 hours post-exercise compared to only 2 of the 9 phyla/genera in controls (p = 0.005). There was also a significant difference in clearance of specific bacterial phyla from blood following exercise with high levels of bacterial sequences maintained at 72 hours post-exercise in ME/CFS patients versus clearance in the controls. These results provide evidence for a systemic effect of an altered gut microbiome in ME/CFS patients compared to controls. Upon exercise challenge, there were significant changes in the abundance of major bacterial phyla in the gut in ME/CFS patients not observed in healthy controls. In addition, compared to controls clearance of bacteria from the blood was delayed in ME/CFS patients following exercise. These findings suggest a role for an altered gut microbiome and increased bacterial translocation following exercise in ME/CFS patients that may account for the profound post-exertional malaise experienced by ME/CFS patients.",[],PloS one,2015-12-20,"[{'lastname': 'Shukla', 'firstname': 'Sanjay K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, Marshfield, WI, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Cook', 'firstname': 'Dane', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'William S.

118,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,26613325,Review of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: an evidence-based approach to diagnosis and management by clinicians.,"This review was written from the viewpoint of the treating clinician to educate health care professionals and the public about Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). It includes: the clinical definition of ME/CFS with emphasis on how to diagnose ME/CFS; the etiology, pathophysiology, management approach, long-term prognosis and economic cost of ME/CFS. After reading this review, you will be better able to diagnose and treat your patients with ME/CFS using the tools and information provided. Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, chronic medical condition characterized by symptom clusters that include: pathological fatigue and malaise that is worse after exertion, cognitive dysfunction, immune dysfunction, unrefreshing sleep, pain, autonomic dysfunction, neuroendocrine and immune symptoms. ME/CFS is common, often severely disabling and costly. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed the ME/CFS literature and estimates that between 836,000 and 2.5 million Americans have ME/CFS at a cost of between 17 and 24 billion dollars annually in the US. The IOM suggested a new name for ME/CFS and called it Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID). SEID's diagnostic criteria are less specific and do not exclude psychiatric disorders in the criteria. The 2010 Canadian Community Health Survey discovered that 29% of patients with ME/CFS had unmet health care needs and 20% had food insecurity--lack of access to sufficient healthy foods. ME/CFS can be severely disabling and cause patients to be bedridden. Yet most patients (80%) struggle to get a diagnosis because doctors have not been taught how to diagnose or treat ME/CFS in medical schools or in their post-graduate educational training. Consequently, the patients with ME/CFS suffer. They are not diagnosed with ME/CFS and are not treated accordingly. Instead of compassionate care from their doctors, they are often ridiculed by the very people from whom they seek help. The precise etiology of ME/CFS remains unknown, but recent advances and research discoveries are beginning to shed light on the enigma of this disease including the following contributors: infectious, genetic, immune, cognitive including sleep, metabolic and biochemical abnormalities. Management of patients with ME/CFS is supportive symptomatic treatment with a patient centered care approach that begins with the symptoms that are most troublesome for the patient. Pacing of activities with strategic rest periods is, in our opinion, the most important coping strategy patients can learn to better manage their illness and stop their post-exertional fatigue and malaise. Pacing allows patients to regain the ability to plan activities and begin to make slow incremental improvements in functionality.",[],Reviews on environmental health,2015-11-28,"[{'lastname': 'Bested', 'firstname': 'Alison C', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Marshall', 'firstname': 'Lynn M', 'initials': 'LM', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,10.1515/reveh-2015-0026,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x157b730b0>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,26613325,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26613325,91,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

New ME/CFS case definitions based on consensus criteria among experts are largely inadequate, e.g. those of the US Institute of Medicine .
The aim of the present study was to delineate a new case definition of ME/CFS based on pattern recognition methods and using neuro-immune, inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (neuro-IO&NS) biomarkers as external validating criteria.
We measured the 12-item Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating (FF) Scale in 196 subjects with CFS (CDC criteria) and 83 with chronic fatigue. The ""Neuro-IO&NS"" biomarkers were: IgM / IgA responses against LPS of gut commensal bacteria (leaky gut), IgM responses to O&NS modified neoepitopes, autoimmunity to serotonin, plasma interleukin-1 (IL-1) and serum neopterin.
Cluster analysis showed the presence of two well-separated clusters with highly significant differences in symptoms and biomarkers. The cluster with higher scores on all FF items was externally validated against all IO&NS biomarkers and therefore this diagnostic group was labeled ""Neuro-IO&NS Fatigue"" or ""Neuro-Inflammatory and Oxidative Fatigue"" (NIOF). An algorithm was constructed which defined NIOF as chronic fatigue and 4 or more of the following 6 symptoms: muscle tension, memory disturbances, sleep disorders, irritable bowel, headache or a flu-like malaise.

16935968",Consulting patients in setting priorities in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E.) research: findings from a national on-line survey.,"Myalgic encephalitis (M.E.) is a common condition, the cause of which is not known and there are no treatments available. In this study the national patient support group Action for M.E. sought the opinions of their members via an online survey as to what they felt should be future priorities for M.E.
Respondents were asked what they considered first, second and third research priorities to be from a list of 13 pre-defined options. Individuals were invited to provide additional free text comments about Action for M.E.'s research priorities in general. Of the 1144 respondents: 822 had M.E.; 94 were a supporting a member of Action for M.E. ; 66 were carers for someone with M.E.; 26 were professionals with an interest in M.E.; 136 had a family member or colleague with M.E. Individuals selected more than one category as applicable. The top five research priorities identified were: disease processes to achieve a better understanding of the causes of M.E.; more effective treatments; faster and more accurate diagnosis; clinical course of M.E.; outcomes and natural history; and severely affected patients. Least popular priorities were: sleep; economic research towards identifying the cost of ME; and psychological aspects. Much of the free text comments emphasised the importance of funding biomedical research into disease processes to achieve a better understanding of the causes of M.E. Three themes were identified in relation to this topic: accurate diagnosis and awareness; risk factors and causes; drug development and curative therapies. In conclusion; individuals affected by M.E. have clear views regarding priorities for research investment. These have informed Action for M.E.'s ongoing research strategy and ultimately will inform national and international research priorities.
The aim of this work was to involve patients in setting future priorities for myalgic encephalomyelitis (M.E.) research.
A national on-line survey was developed collecting structured and unstructured data. Respondents were asked what they considered Action for M.E.’s first, second and third research priorities to be from a list of 13 pre-defined options. Individuals were also invited to provide any additional free text comments about Action for M.E.’s research priorities in general. A total of 1144 individuals completed the on-line survey. Respondents were asked to indicate if: they had M.E. (n = 822; 90.4 %); were a supporting a member of Action for M.E. (n = 94; 10.3 %); carer for someone with M.E.

121,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,26375519,An abridged version of the Cochrane review of exercise therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome.,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) is estimated to affect between 2 in 1000 and 2 in 100 adults depending on how diagnostic criteria are applied. Patients with CFS have long-lasting fatigue in addition to symptoms including muscle pain, concentration and sleep problems. These symptoms cause significant disability and distress to the people affected. This review is an update of a previous Cochrane review (2004) that showed that exercise therapy was a promising treatment for adults with CFS.
The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effects of exercise therapy for patients with CFS.
Systematic review.
Health care settings.
Participants over 18 years with a primary diagnosis of CFS, able to attend an outpatient clinic for exercise therapy, were included.
We searched electronic databases, including SPORTDiscus, up to May 2014 using a comprehensive list of free-text terms for CFS and exercise. Randomized clinical trials from all health care settings with participants over 18 years with a primary diagnosis of CFS, able to attend an outpatient clinic for exercise therapy, were included. We have included 8 randomized clinical studies that reported data from 1518 participants. Seven studies used aerobic exercise such as walking, swimming, or cycling and one study used non-aerobic exercise. The exercise therapies lasted between 12 and 26 weeks. Meta-analysis was done when appropriate.
Exercise therapy was more effective at reducing fatigue than ""passive"" treatments or no treatment at end of treatment. Exercise therapy also had a positive effect on people's daily physical functioning, sleep quality and self-rated overall health. Nearly twice as many patients reported improvement self-rated overall health after exercise therapy (40 per 100) compared to standard treatment (22 per 100). The evidence was too sparse and/or of too low quality to conclude if exercise therapy has an effect on pain, quality of life, anxiety or depression. Exercise therapy was not found to worsen symptoms for people with CFS, while serious side effects were rare in all exercise and comparison groups.
Patiens with CFS may generally benefit from and feel less fatigued following exercise therapy, and no evidence suggests that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes.

26854153",Chronic Fatigue Syndrome versus Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease.,"The Institute of Medicine has recommended a change in the name and criteria for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), renaming the illness Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease (SEID). The new SEID case definition requires substantial reductions or impairments in the ability to engage in pre-illness activities, unrefreshing sleep, post-exertional malaise, and either cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance.
In the current study, samples were generated through several different methods and were used to compare this new case definition to previous case definitions for CFS, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME-ICC), Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), as well as a case definition developed through empirical methods.
We used a cross-sectional design with samples from tertiary care settings, a biobank sample, and other forums. 796 patients from the US, Great Britain, and Norway completed the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire.
Findings indicated that the SEID criteria identified 88% of participants in the samples analyzed, which is comparable to the 92% that met the Fukuda criteria. The SEID case definition was compared to a four item empiric criteria, and findings indicated that the four item empiric criteria identified a smaller, more functionally limited and symptomatic group of patients.
The recently developed SEID criteria appears to identify a group comparable in size to the Fukuda et al. criteria, but a larger group of patients than the Canadian ME/CFS and ME criteria, and selects more patients who have less impairment and fewer symptoms than a four item empiric criteria.","['Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'Systemic Exertion Intolerance Disease', 'case definitions', 'chronic fatigue syndrome']","Fatigue : biomedicine, health & behavior",2015-09-09,"[{'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Sunnquist', 'firstname': 'Madison', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Abigail', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Newton', 'firstname': 'Julia L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Newcastle University.'}, {'lastname': 'Strand', 'firstname': 'Elin Bolle', 'initials': 'EB', 'affiliation': 'Oslo University Hospital.'}, {'lastname': 'Vernon', 'firstname': 'Suzanne D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Solve ME/CFS Initiative.'}]",None,"The recently developed SEID criteria appears to identify a group comparable in size to the Fukuda et al. criteria, but a larger group of patients than the Canadian ME/CFS and ME criteria, and selects more patients who have less impairment and fewer symptoms than a four item empiric criteria.","Findings indicated that the SEID criteria identified 88% of participants in the samples analyzed, which is comparable to the 92% that met the Fukuda criteria.

1593914",Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis: Toward An Empirical Case Definition.,"Current case definitions of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) have been based on consensus methods, but empirical methods could be used to identify core symptoms and thereby improve the reliability. In the present study, several methods (i.e., continuous scores of symptoms, theoretically and empirically derived cut off scores of symptoms) were used to identify core symptoms best differentiating patients from controls. In addition, data mining with decision trees was conducted. Our study found a small number of core symptoms that have good sensitivity and specificity, and these included fatigue, post-exertional malaise, a neurocognitive symptom, and unrefreshing sleep. Outcomes from these analyses suggest that using empirically selected symptoms can help guide the creation of a more reliable case definition.","['Myalgic Encephalomyelitits', 'biomarkers', 'case definitions', 'chronic fatigue syndrome']",Health psychology and behavioral medicine,2015-06-02,"[{'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Kot', 'firstname': 'Bobby', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Sunnquist', 'firstname': 'Madison', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Abigail', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Evans', 'firstname': 'Meredyth', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Jantke', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Yolonda', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Furst', 'firstname': 'Jacob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'DePaul University.'}, {'lastname': 'Vernon', 'firstname': 'Suzanne D', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Solve ME/CFS Initiative.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.1080/21642850.2015.1014489

21554673",Variability in Symptoms Complicates Utility of Case Definitions.,"Ambiguities in case definitions have created difficulties in replicating findings and estimating the prevalence rates for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME).
The current study examined differences in occurrence rates for CFS and ME cardinal symptoms (i.e. post-exertional malaise, unrefreshing sleep, and neurocognitive deficits).
Findings indicated that there is a wide range of occurrence rates on critical symptoms of the case definition, suggesting that either the types of patients recruited differ in various settings or the questions assessing core symptoms vary in their wording or criteria among different researchers.
The polythetic nature of the case definition may contribute to the wide ranges of symptom occurrence that was found. In order to increase assessed reliability of the symptoms and case definitions, there is a need to better standardize data collection methods and operationalization of symptoms. This solution would reduce the heterogeneity often seen in populations of CFS patients.","['chronic fatigue syndrome', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'operationalization', 'symptom occurrence']","Fatigue : biomedicine, health & behavior",2015-01-01,"[{'lastname': 'McManimen', 'firstname': 'Stephanie L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jason', 'firstname': 'Leonard A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Yolonda J', 'initials': 'YJ', 'affiliation': 'Center for Community Research, DePaul University, Chicago, IL USA.'}]",None,None,"Findings indicated that there is a wide range of occurrence rates on critical symptoms of the case definition, suggesting that either the types of patients recruited differ in various settings or the questions assessing core symptoms vary in their wording or criteria among different researchers.",None,10.1080/21641846.2015.1041336,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x157bc61b0>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,27088057,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27088057,10,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

23794547",Pilot study investigating the utility of a specialized online symptom management program for individuals with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome as compared to an online meditation program.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a long-term, debilitating condition that impacts numerous areas of individuals' lives. The two predominant treatment options for ME/CFS are cognitive behavioral therapy and graded exercise therapy; however, many people have found these techniques unacceptable or even damaging. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the utility of a specialized online symptom management program for ME/CFS in comparison to an online meditation program in an effort to ascertain whether this tool could be a further option for those with ME/CFS.
THIS EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN CONSISTED OF TWO INTERVENTIONS: a specialized online symptoms management program (N=19) and a control intervention based on an online meditation website (N=9). A battery of questionnaires, including measures of multidimensional fatigue, illness-specific symptoms, perceived control, and mindful awareness, were completed before the participants commenced use of the programs and following 8 weeks' use.
Significant differences were found in the areas of chance and powerful others' locus of control, and sleeping difficulties, but not in ME/CFS symptomatology overall.
The specialized online program described in this study warrants further investigation, as it appears to influence perceived control and key ME/CFS symptoms over time.","['ME/CFS', 'online intervention', 'outcomes', 'perceived control', 'sleep']",Psychology research and behavior management,2014-09-13,"[{'lastname': 'Arroll', 'firstname': 'Megan A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Research Team, School of Psychology, University of East London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Attree', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Research Team, School of Psychology, University of East London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Marshall', 'firstname': 'Clare L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Research Team, School of Psychology, University of East London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Dancey', 'firstname': 'Christine P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Research Team, School of Psychology, University of East London, London, UK.'}]",None,"The specialized online program described in this study warrants further investigation, as it appears to influence perceived control and key ME/CFS symptoms over time.","Significant differences were found in the areas of chance and powerful others' locus of control, and sleeping difficulties, but not in ME/CFS symptomatology overall.",None,10.2147/PRBM.S63193,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x157bce9d0>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,25214803,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25214803,1,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

19955554","The status of and future research into Myalgic Encephalomyelitis and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome: the need of accurate diagnosis, objective assessment, and acknowledging biological and clinical subgroups.","Although Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) are used interchangeably, the diagnostic criteria define two distinct clinical entities. Cognitive impairment, (muscle) weakness, circulatory disturbances, marked variability of symptoms, and, above all, post-exertional malaise: a long-lasting increase of symptoms after a minor exertion, are distinctive symptoms of ME. This latter phenomenon separates ME, a neuro-immune illness, from chronic fatigue (syndrome), other disorders and deconditioning. The introduction of the label, but more importantly the diagnostic criteria for CFS have generated much confusion, mostly because chronic fatigue is a subjective and ambiguous notion. CFS was redefined in 1994 into unexplained (persistent or relapsing) chronic fatigue, accompanied by at least four out of eight symptoms, e.g., headaches and unrefreshing sleep. Most of the research into ME and/or CFS in the last decades was based upon the multivalent CFS criteria, which define a heterogeneous patient group. Due to the fact that fatigue and other symptoms are non-discriminative, subjective experiences, research has been hampered. Various authors have questioned the physiological nature of the symptoms and qualified ME/CFS as somatization. However, various typical symptoms can be assessed objectively using standardized methods. Despite subjective and unclear criteria and measures, research has observed specific abnormalities in ME/CFS repetitively, e.g., immunological abnormalities, oxidative and nitrosative stress, neurological anomalies, circulatory deficits and mitochondrial dysfunction. However, to improve future research standards and patient care, it is crucial that patients with post-exertional malaise (ME) and patients without this odd phenomenon are acknowledged as separate clinical entities that the diagnosis of ME and CFS in research and clinical practice is based upon accurate criteria and an objective assessment of characteristic symptoms, as much as possible that well-defined clinical and biological subgroups of ME and CFS patients are investigated in more detail, and that patients are monitored before, during and after interventions with objective measures and biomarkers.","['Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis', 'assessment', 'diagnosis', 'immune system', 'post-exertional malaise', 'subgroups']",Frontiers in physiology,2014-04-16,"[{'lastname': 'Twisk', 'firstname': 'Frank N M', 'initials': 'FN', 'affiliation': 'ME-de-Patiënten Foundation Limmen, Netherlands.'}]",None,None,None,None,"10.3389/fphys.2014.00109

19111923",Psychosocial factors involved in memory and cognitive failures in people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is characterized by persistent emotional, mental, and physical fatigue accompanied by a range of neurological, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and sleep problems. Research has shown that psychosocial factors such as anxiety and depression as well as the symptoms of the illness, have a significant impact on the quality of life of people with ME/CFS. In addition, individuals may suffer from deficits in memory and concentration. This study set out to explore the relationships between variables which have been found to contribute to cognitive performance, as measured by prospective and retrospective memory, and cognitive failures.
Eighty-seven people with ME/CFS answered questionnaires measuring fatigue, depression, anxiety, social support, and general self-efficacy. These were used in a correlational design (multiple regression) to predict cognitive function (self-ratings on prospective and retrospective memory), and cognitive failures.
Our study found that fatigue, depression, and general self-efficacy were directly associated with cognitive failures and retrospective (but not prospective) memory.
Although it was not possible in this study to determine the cause of the deficits, the literature in this area leads us to suggest that although the pathophysiological mechanisms of ME/CFS are unclear, abnormalities in the immune system, including proinflammatory cytokines, can lead to significant impairments in cognition. We suggest that fatigue and depression may be a result of the neurobiological effects of ME/CFS and in addition, that the neurobiological effects of the illness may give rise to both fatigue and cognitive deficits independently.","['cognitive deficits', 'depression', 'memory', 'myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome']",Psychology research and behavior management,2014-03-07,"[{'lastname': 'Attree', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Research Team, School of Psychology, University of East London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Arroll', 'firstname': 'Megan A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Research Team, School of Psychology, University of East London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Dancey', 'firstname': 'Christine P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Research Team, School of Psychology, University of East London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Griffith', 'firstname': 'Charlene', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Research Team, School of Psychology, University of East London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Bansal', 'firstname': 'Amolak S', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Chronic Illness Research Team, School of Psychology, University of East London, London, UK ; Department of Immunology and the Sutton CFS Service, St Helier Hospital, Carshalton, UK.'}]",None,"Although it was not possible in this study to determine the cause of the deficits, the literature in this area leads us to suggest that although the pathophysiological mechanisms of ME/CFS are unclear, abnormalities in the immune system, including proinflammatory cytokines, can lead to significant impairments in cognition.

There remains to be a singular biomarker identified for this illness, hence numerous theories about its development and perpetuation have been posited in the literature. This brief report presents the model of 'allostasis' as a framework for understanding ME/CFS, specifically the notion that the physiological mechanisms employed in the body to deal with stress termed here as 'allostatic states' (e.g. elevation of inflammatory cytokines), may in and of themselves contribute to the perpetuation of the disorder. This theoretical assertion has important consequences for the understanding of ME/CFS and treatment; rather than searching for a singular pathogen responsible for this condition, ME/CFS can be conceptualised as a maladaptive stress disorder and interventions aimed at addressing the allostatic states may be incorporated into current symptom management programmes.",[],Medical hypotheses,2013-07-16,"[{'lastname': 'Arroll', 'firstname': 'Megan Anne', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'The Optimum Health Clinic, Head Office and Training Centre, Bickerton House, 25-27 Bickerton Road, London N19 5JT, United Kingdom. drarroll@theoptimumhealthclinic.com'}]",None,None,None,Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Such disorders are the result of a complex physiological interaction of central and peripheral nervous signaling that leads to a highly individual symptom complex, although some of them seem to be related to one another, especially in terms of the mechanism of chronicity and pain amplification, and the co-occurrence of fatigue, sleep alterations, mood disturbances and cognitive impairment.

10461935",A Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) severity score based on case designation criteria.,"Chronic Fatigue Syndrome case designation criteria are scored as physicians' subjective, nominal interpretations of patient fatigue, pain (headaches, myalgia, arthralgia, sore throat and lymph nodes), cognitive dysfunction, sleep and exertional exhaustion.
Subjects self-reported symptoms using an anchored ordinal scale of 0 (no symptom), 1 (trivial complaints), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), and 4 (severe). Fatigue of 3 or 4 distinguished ""Fatigued"" from ""Not Fatigued"" subjects. The sum of the 8(Sum8) ancillary criteria was tested as a proxy for fatigue. All subjects had history and physical examinations to exclude medical fatigue, and ensure categorization as healthy or CFS subjects.
Fatigued subjects were divided into CFS with ≥4 symptoms or Chronic Idiopathic Fatigue (CIF) with ≤3 symptoms. ROC of Sum8 for CFS and Not Fatigued subjects generated a threshold of 14 (specificity=0.934; sensitivity=0.928). CFS (n=256) and CIF (n=55) criteria were refined to include Sum8≥14 and ≤13, respectively. Not Fatigued subjects had highly skewed Sum8 responses. Healthy Controls (HC; n=269) were defined by fatigue≤2 and Sum8≤13. Those with Sum8≥14 were defined as CFS-Like With Insufficient Fatigue Syndrome (CFSLWIFS; n=20). Sum8 and Fatigue were highly correlated (R(2)=0.977; Cronbach's alpha=0.924) indicating an intimate relationship between symptom constructs. Cluster analysis suggested 4 clades each in CFS and HC. Translational utility was inferred from the clustering of proteomics from cerebrospinal fluid.
Plotting Fatigue severity versus Sum8 produced an internally consistent classifying system.

15642872",Sleep abnormalities in chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis: a review.,"Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a chronic, disabling illness that affects approximately 0.2% of the population. Non-restorative sleep despite sufficient or extended total sleep time is one of the major clinical diagnostic criteria; however, the underlying cause of this symptom is unknown. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature examining sleep in CFS/ME and the issues surrounding the current research findings. Polysomnographic and other objective measures of sleep have observed few differences in sleep parameters between CFS/ME patients and healthy controls, although some discrepancies do exist. This lack of significant objective differences contrasts with the common subjective complaints of disturbed and unrefreshed sleep by CFS/ME patients. The emergence of new, more sensitive techniques that examine the microstructure of sleep are showing promise for detecting differences in sleep between patients and healthy individuals. There is preliminary evidence that alterations in sleep stage transitions and sleep instability, and other physiological mechanisms, such as heart rate variability and altered cortisol profiles, may be evident.

22281935",Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction in the treatment of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) - a clinical audit.,"We report on an audit of 138 ME/CFS patients who attended a private practice and took the ATP Profile biomedical test. The results revealed that all of these patients had measureable mitochondrial dysfunction. A basic treatment regime, based on 1) eating the evolutionary correct stone-age diet, 2) ensuring optimum hours of good quality sleep, 3) taking a standard package of nutritional supplements, and 4) getting the right balance between work and rest, was recommended for all patients. Additions to the basic regime were tailored for each patient according to the results of the ATP Profile and additional nutritional tests and clues from the clinical history. Mitochondrial function is typically impaired in two ways: substrate or co-factor deficiency, and inhibition by chemicals, exogenous or endogenous. For the former, additional nutrients are recommended where there is a deficiency, and for the latter, improvement of anti-oxidant status and selective chelation therapy or far-infrared saunas are appropriate. We show case histories of nine patients who have taken the ATP Profile on three or four occasions, and a before-and-after treatment summary of the 34 patients who have had at least two ATP Profile tests separated by some months. Finally, we summarize the results for the 30 patients who followed all aspects of the treatment regime and compare them with the 4 patients who were lax on two or more aspects of the treatment regime. All patients who followed the treatment regime improved in mitochondrial function by on average a factor of 4.","['Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)', 'Cellular energetics', 'Chronic fatigue syndrome', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction', 'Myalgic encephalomyelitis', 'Nutrition', 'Oxidative phosphorylation']",International journal of clinical and experimental medicine,2012-12-14,"[{'lastname': 'Myhill', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Sarah Myhill Ltd Llangunllo, Powys UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Booth', 'firstname': 'Norman E', 'initials': 'NE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'McLaren-Howard', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,None,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x157cbc090>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,23236553,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23236553,0,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

4803272","A preliminary prospective study of nutritional, psychological and combined therapies for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) in a private care setting.","Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a condition characterised by severe and persistent fatigue, neurological disturbances, autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions and sleep difficulties that have a pronounced and significant impact on individuals' lives. Current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines within the UK suggest that this condition should be treated with cognitive behavioural therapy and/or graded exercise therapy, where appropriate. There is currently a lack of an evidence base concerning alternative techniques that may be beneficial to those with ME/CFS.
This study aimed to investigate whether three modalities of psychology, nutrition and combined treatment influenced symptom report measures in those with ME/CFS over a 3-month time period and whether there were significant differences in these changes between groups.
This is a preliminary prospective study with one follow-up point conducted at a private secondary healthcare facility in London, UK.
138 individuals (110 females, 79.7%; 42 participants in psychology, 44 in nutrition and 52 in combined) participated at baseline and 72 participants completed the battery of measures at follow-up (52.17% response rate; 14, 27 and 31 participants in each group, respectively).
Self-reported measures of ME/CFS symptoms, functional ability, multidimensional fatigue and perceived control.
Baseline comparisons showed those in the combined group had higher levels of fatigue. At follow-up, all groups saw improvements in fatigue, functional ability and symptomatology; those within the psychology group also experienced a shift in perceived control over time.
This study provides early evidence that psychological, nutritional and combined techniques for the treatment of ME/CFS may influence symptomatology, fatigue, function and perceived control. However, these results must be viewed with caution as the allocation to groups was not randomised, there was no control group and the study suffered from high drop-out rates.",[],BMJ open,2012-11-21,"[{'lastname': 'Arroll', 'firstname': 'Megan Anne', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Research, The Optimum Health Clinic, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Howard', 'firstname': 'Alex', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,"Baseline comparisons showed those in the combined group had higher levels of fatigue.

There is a strong comorbidity and a biological similarity between major depression and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).
The aim of the present study was to examine ""psychosomatic"" symptoms reminiscent of ME/CFS in major depression.
Toward this end, we examined the 12-item Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating (FF) Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) in 103 major depressed patients by means of multivariate pattern recognition methods. results: Our findings support the existence of two factors, i.e. a fatigue and somatic (F&S) factor, i.e aches and pain, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties, failing memory, irritability, irritable bowel, headache, and a subjective experience of infection; and a depression factor, i.e. sadness, irritability, sleep disorders, autonomic symptoms, and a subjective experience of infection. Cluster analysis performed on the 12 FF items found two different clusters, which were separated by highly significant differences in the F&S items, the most significant being a subjective experience of infection, aches and pain, muscular tension, fatigue, concentration difficulties and failing memory. Multivariate analyses showed that the differences between both clusters were quantitatively, and not qualitatively, and reflected the severity of the F&S dimension. There was a strong association between the F&S symptoms and melancholia and chronic depression. Treatment resistant depression was characterized by higher scores on the depression factor score. There was a strong correlation between the HDRS score and the FF items, fatigue, a subjective experience of infection, and sadness. Our findings show that F&S symptoms are a major feature of depression and largely predict severity of illness, and chronic and melancholic depression.

136,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,18801465,Immunological aspects of chronic fatigue syndrome.,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a specific clinical condition that characterises unexplained disabling fatigue and a combination of non-specific accompanying symptoms for at least 6 months, in the absence of a medical diagnosis that would otherwise explain the clinical presentation. Other common symptoms include headaches, myalgia, arthralgia, and post-exertional malaise; cognitive difficulties, with impaired memory and concentration; unrefreshing sleep; and mood changes. Similar disorders have been described for at least two centuries and have been differently named neurasthenia, post-viral fatigue, myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic mononucleosis. Recent longitudinal studies suggest that some people affected by chronic fatigue syndrome improve with time but that most remain functionally impaired for several years. The estimated worldwide prevalence of CFS is 0.4-1% and it affects over 800,000 people in the United States and approximately 240,000 patients in the UK. No physical examination signs are specific to CFS and no diagnostic tests identify this syndrome. The pathophysiological mechanism of CFS is unclear. The main hypotheses include altered central nervous system functioning resulting from an abnormal immune response against a common antigen; a neuroendocrine disturbance; cognitive impairment caused by response to infection or other stimuli in sentient people. The current concept is that CFS pathogenesis is a multifactorial condition. Various studies have sought evidence for a disturbance in immunity in people with CFS. An alteration in cytokine profile, a decreased function of natural killer (NK) cells, a presence of autoantibodies and a reduced responses of T cells to mitogens and other specific antigens have been reported. The observed high level of pro-inflammatory cytokines may explain some of the manifestations such as fatigue and flu-like symptoms and influence NK activity. Abnormal activation of the T lymphocyte subsets and a decrease in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity have been described. An increased number of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and CD38 and HLA-DR activation markers have been reported, and a decrease in CD11b expression associated with an increased expression of CD28+ T subsets has been observed. This review discusses the immunological aspects of CFS and offers an immunological hypothesis for the disease processes.",[],Autoimmunity reviews,2008-09-20,"[{'lastname': 'Lorusso', 'firstname': 'Lorenzo', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Mellino Mellini Hospital, Chiari, Brescia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Mikhaylova', 'firstname': 'Svetlana V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Capelli', 'firstname': 'Enrica', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ferrari', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ngonga', 'firstname': 'Gaelle K', 'initials': 'GK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Ricevuti', 'firstname': 'Giovanni', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': None}]",None,None,None,None,10.1016/j.autrev.2008.08.003,<Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x157cddd50>,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,18801465,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18801465,183,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan

The authors have recently reported a study of gene expression that identified differential expression of 88 human genes in patients with CFS/ME. Clustering of quantitative PCR (qPCR) data from patients with CFS/ME revealed seven distinct subtypes with distinct differences in Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 scores, clinical phenotypes and severity.
In this study, for each CFS/ME subtype, those genes whose expression differed significantly from that of normal blood donors were identified, and then gene interactions, disease associations and molecular and cellular functions of those gene sets were determined. Genomic analysis was then related to clinical data for each CFS/ME subtype.
Genomic analysis revealed some common (neurological, haematological, cancer) and some distinct (metabolic, endocrine, cardiovascular, immunological, inflammatory) disease associations among the subtypes. Subtypes 1, 2 and 7 were the most severe, and subtype 3 was the mildest. Clinical features of each subtype were as follows: subtype 1 (cognitive, musculoskeletal, sleep, anxiety/depression); subtype 2 (musculoskeletal, pain, anxiety/depression); subtype 3 (mild); subtype 4 (cognitive); subtype 5 (musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal); subtype 6 (postexertional); subtype 7 (pain, infectious, musculoskeletal, sleep, neurological, gastrointestinal, neurocognitive, anxiety/depression).

Improvement may occur with medical care and additional therapies of pacing, cognitive behavioural therapy and graded exercise therapy. The latter two therapies have been found to be efficacious in small trials, but patient organisations surveys have reported adverse effects. Although pacing has been advocated by patient organisations, it lacks empirical support. Specialist medical care is commonly provided but its efficacy when given alone is not established. This trial compares the efficacy of the additional therapies when added to specialist medical care against specialist medical care alone.
600 patients, who meet operationalised diagnostic criteria for CFS, will be recruited from secondary care into a randomised trial of four treatments, stratified by current co morbid depressive episode and different CFS/ME criteria. The four treatments are standardised specialist medical care either given alone, or with adaptive pacing therapy or cognitive behaviour therapy or graded exercise therapy. Supplementary therapies will involve fourteen sessions over 23 weeks and a booster session at 36 weeks. Outcome will be assessed at 12, 24, and 52 weeks after randomisation. Two primary outcomes of self-rated fatigue and physical function will assess differential effects of each treatment on these measures. Secondary outcomes include adverse events and reactions, subjective measures of symptoms, mood, sleep and function and objective measures of physical activity, fitness, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. The primary analysis will be based on intention to treat and will use logistic regression models to compare treatments. Secondary outcomes will be analysed by repeated measures analysis of variance with a linear mixed model. All analyses will allow for stratification factors. Mediators and moderators will be explored using multiple linear and logistic regression techniques with interactive terms, with the sample split into two to allow validation of the initial models. Economic analyses will incorporate sensitivity measures.

139,myalgic-encephalomyelitis|Sleep,14650782,Chronic fatigue syndrome. The patient centred clinical method--a guide for the perplexed.,"Chronic fatigue states are common in general practice and over the past 20 years there has been considerable worldwide consensus developed on the criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) also commonly known as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). Chronic fatigue syndrome is an illness characterised by the new onset of disabling fatigue, accompanied by cognitive, musculoskeletal and sleep symptoms. There are no specific diagnostic tests or biological markers and the diagnosis is made by ruling out other causes of fatigue. The pathophysiology of CFS is still unclear.
This article discusses the application of the patient centred clinical method to the diagnosis and treatment of CFS.
There is no new breakthrough in the diagnosis or management of CFS in spite of much research and controversy. There is considerable evidence that the best place to manage CFS is in primary care under the care of the patient's own general practitioner, but it has been suggested that doctors feel unable to deal with the problem. The patient centred clinical method offers a constructive guide to management.

32491608",StatPearls,"Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a chronic disease that potentially affects about two million Americans. The United States Public Health Services initially described it during an epidemiological study of Los Angeles County during the summer of 1934. Chronic fatigue syndrome, also called myalgic encephalomyelitis, is a complex multisystem disease commonly characterized by severe fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, sleep problems, autonomic dysfunction, and post-exertional malaise severely impairing activities of daily living. Outcomes become worse due to the condition remaining undiagnosed for years, secondary to inadequate medical teaching on the subject, provider bias, and confusion regarding diagnosis and treatment of the disease. CFS does not only present with fatigue but also cognitive dysfunction and impairment of routine functioning that persists for six months or more. CFS is a biological condition, not a psychological disorder. The exact pathogenesis remains to be fully understood. Various mechanisms and biochemical changes have been implicated that affect immune function, hormonal regulation, and response to oxidative stress. It also includes natural killer cell dysfunction and/or T-cell dysfunction, elevated cytokines, and autoantibodies. The infectious cause has been proposed, but no causal relationship has been identified. Patients with CFS can sometimes present to the emergency department with a list of complex symptoms, such as orthostatic intolerance, postexertional malaise (PEM), fatigue, and diarrhea.",nan,nan,2023,"[{'collective': None, 'lastname': 'Sapra', 'firstname': 'Amit', 'initials': 'A'}, {'collective': None, 'lastname': 'Bhandari', 'firstname': 'Priyanka', 'initials': 'P'}]",nan,nan,nan,"Copyright © 2023, StatPearls Publishing LLC.",None,nan,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,26126237,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26126237,0,None,eng,Study Guide,"[{'title': 'Continuing Education Activity', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Introduction', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Etiology', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Epidemiology', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Pathophysiology', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'History and Physical', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Evaluation', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Treatment / Management', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Differential Diagnosis', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Prognosis', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Complications', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Deterrence and Patient Education', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'Review Questions', 'chapter': None}, {'title': 'References', 'chapter': None}]",StatPearls Publishing,Treasure Island (FL)

Pharmacological interventions are however commonly used for symptomatic relief in people with ME/CFS, for example for pain and sleep, even though evidence from clinical trials in ME/CFS may be lacking. Approaches can also be used for co-morbid conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, migraine-type headaches, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or vitamin D deficiency. Many people report self-medicating with vitamins and supplements. The committee evaluated evidence from clinical effectiveness studies and patient experience from a wide range of pharmacological management strategies to inform the recommendation in these areas. The clinical and cost effectiveness methods and evidence found are outlined Evidence review G: Non pharmacological management as well as the methods and evidence found for the review on the experiences of people who have had interventions for ME/CFS.",nan,nan,2021,"[{'collective': 'National Guideline Centre (UK)', 'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None}]",nan,nan,nan,Copyright © NICE 2021.,None,nan,myalgic-encephalomyelitis,Sleep,35467812,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35467812,0,9781473142213,eng,Review,[],National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),London
