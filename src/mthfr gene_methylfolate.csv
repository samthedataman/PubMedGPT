0,37088147,l-Methylfolate in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: A Narrative Review.,"One of the most frequently occurring complications of diabetes mellitus is peripheral neuropathy. Despite the painful symptoms associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), the current treatment landscape focuses on managing symptoms without addressing the underlying causes of DPN. This narrative review describes the mechanistic effects and clinical trial data supporting the use of l-methylfolate calcium (LMF), the bioactive form of folate, which is available in the United States as a prescription medical food that also contains other B vitamins for the dietary management of DPN.
Preclinical and clinical trial data evaluating the impact of LMF on DPN was identified using PubMed searches for articles published between 2010 and 2023. Search terms included: folate, l-methylfolate, diabetes, neuropathy, and neuropathic pain. Additionally, a literature search was conducted to identify studies related to LMF, genetic polymorphisms, and DPN pathophysiology.
Several studies show that the C677T variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is linked to greater risk of DPN than other MTHFR variants due to its inhibitory effects on several folic acid metabolic pathways. One double-blind, randomized controlled trial, five open-label studies, and one retrospective study found that LMF has a significant beneficial effect on DPN that extends beyond symptomatic relief to include modulating the underlying pathophysiology that leads to the progression and symptoms of DPN. LMF also significantly improves patient quality of life, with minimal adverse effects.
Preclinical and clinical studies have found that LMF can be used to treat the underlying causes of DPN and provide long-lasting symptomatic relief.","['L-methylfolate', 'diabetic peripheral neuropathy', 'medical food', 'nerve regeneration', 'nutrition', 'type 2 diabetes', 'vitamin B(12) and vitamin B(6)']",Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists,2023-04-24,"[{'lastname': 'Christofides', 'firstname': 'Elena A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Endocrinology Associates, Columbus, OH, USA.

Folate processing (Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, MTHFR) gene abnormalities are common in women with epilepsy and depression. L-methylfolate supplements may bypass MTHFR deficiencies, yet their use in WWE during gestation or on fetal development is not well studied. We examine pregnancy histories of three WWE who supplemented with either folate or L-methylfolate and methylcobalamin (methylated B12) during pregnancies. Their pregnancy outcomes improved with L-methylfolate and methylcobalamin supplementation. L-methylfolate and methylcobalamin supplementation merits further study in WWE who have MTHFR mutations, fertility, recurrent miscarriage and or depression histories.","['ASD, Autism spectrum disorder', 'ASM, Antiseizure medication', 'B-12', 'Fetal', 'MTHFR, Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase', 'Neural tube defect', 'Pregnancy', 'Vitamin', 'WWE, women with epilepsy']",Epilepsy & behavior reports,2021-01-12,"[{'lastname': 'Lascar', 'firstname': 'Emma M', 'initials': 'EM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, University of Washington, 1953 Pacific Ave, Seattle, WA, USA.\nSwedish Epilepsy Center, Swedish Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Warner', 'firstname': 'Nicole M', 'initials': 'NM', 'affiliation': 'Swedish Epilepsy Center, Swedish Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Doherty', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Swedish Epilepsy Center, Swedish Hospital, Seattle, WA, USA.'}]",,,,© 2020 The Author(s).,"10.1016/j.ebr.2020.100419

This case series describes 10 adolescents (mean age 14.4 ± 2.8 years) with treatment-resistant depression prescribed adjunctive l-methylfolate (LM).

3,28671236,Vitamin B Supplementation: What's the Right Choice for Your Patients?,"As many patients turn to vitamins and supplements to enhance energy, relieve fatigue, or generally feel better, it is important to understand the connection between the B vitamins and psychiatric symptomatology. Vitamins B6, B8, and B12 have been shown not only to reduce psychiatric symptoms but also shorten the duration of illness. Vitamin B9, also known as folate or folic acid, has also been associated with psychiatric symptoms. However, when patients lack a specific genetic enzyme, which converts folate/folic acid to its most usable form, L-methylfolate, the neuroprotective and neuropsychiatric benefits are lost. L-methylfolate allows for the synthesis of the three major neurochemicals-serotonin, nor-epinephrine, and dopamine-across the blood-brain barrier. Exploring the conversion of folate/folic acid into L-methylfolate and the various polymorphisms of the MTHFR gene and examining the B vitamins associated with the treatment of psychiatric symptoms will further allow nurses to comprehensively treat their patients with the appropriate B vitamins.

4,27520898,Effectiveness of add-on l-methylfolate therapy in a complex psychiatric illness with MTHFR C677 T genetic polymorphism.,"The 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene plays a central role in folate metabolism. Many studies have demonstrated an association between MTHFR C677 T variant with depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as one of them being comorbid to other. This has justified the use of folate supplement in psychiatric disorders mainly depression but still not in various other comorbid complex psychiatric disorders. Here we have tried to show how the l-methylfolate in conjunction with the conventional psychotropic drugs can be useful in a state of such complex psychiatric phenomenon and comorbid diagnosis with genetic polymorphism of MTHFR C677 T mutation.","['MTHFR genetic polymorphism', 'Obsessive–compulsive disorder', 'Treatment resistant depression']",Asian journal of psychiatry,2016-08-16,"[{'lastname': 'Jha', 'firstname': 'Shailesh', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Human Behavior and Allied Sciences (IHBAS), Dilshad Garden, Delhi 110095, India.

5,22108397,Comparison of the frequency of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism in depressed versus nondepressed patients.,"Numerous studies have found an association between low serum folate levels and incidence of depression. Folic acid supplementation has been successfully used as an adjunct to treat depression in these patients. However, some individuals have a genetic deficiency in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene that limits conversion of folic acid to its biologically active form, L-methylfolate. Several studies have identified a higher frequency of genetic variations in the MTHFR gene in depressed patients than in nondepressed controls. This study evaluated the frequency of the most common genetic variation MTHFR C667T in a group of depressed U.S. Caucasians and compared results with those of a control group of nondepressed U.S. Caucasians. Subjects were recruited from a psychiatric practice, an ambulatory care clinic, and the community. Informed consent and a cheek swab sample were obtained from each subject for analysis using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Allele and genotype frequencies were compared using Pearson X2 analysis. Complete data were obtained for 156 subjects. No significant differences were found in frequency of the MTHFR C667T T allele (0.415 vs 0.365; p=0.408) or the MTHFR C667T TT genotype (20.7% vs 17.6%; p=0.619) between the depressed and non-depressed controls, respectively. Therefore, use of L-methylfolate without an additional indication of need does not appear to be warranted in this group of U.S. Caucasians. Some patients may benefit from L-methylfolate, but an evidence-based approach, such as MTHFR genotyping, should be used to identify these specific patients. Additional research is also needed to confirm the benefit of L-methylfolate in specific patient populations (e.g., MTHFR TT genotype).",[],Journal of psychiatric practice,2011-11-24,"[{'lastname': 'Lizer', 'firstname': 'Mitsi H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Bernard J.

3177266",Relations between molecular and biological abnormalities in 11 families from siblings affected with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency.,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting in elevated homocysteine levels in plasma and urine. MTHFR catalyses the reduction of methylenetetrahydrofolate to methyltetrahydrofolate, a cofactor for homocysteine remethylation to methionine. MTHFR deficiency may be diagnosed from infancy to adulthood with a broad spectrum of clinical symptoms. A molecular analysis of the MTHFR gene combined with an assessment of MTHFR activity, plasma homocysteine and folate in plasma and red blood cells (RBC), especially methylfolate, was assessed in the members of 11 families from children affected with this disorder. This study was performed to try to define the impact of the mutations found in the MTHFR gene on symptoms and biological abnormalities. A total of 14 mutations were found and 10 of them were identified for the first time. Two were found in two families, two more in two other families and one in three families. The position of the mutation spread all over the gene does not predict the degree of biological abnormalities found in parents or healthy siblings bearing the mutation. Two different mutations located not far apart on the same exon may cause mild or severe abnormalities. The thermolabile variant C677T when expressed in an homozygote state in some parents was associated with lower MTHFR activity, higher homocysteine levels, lower folate levels, mainly methylfolate in RBC than in parents without the mutation; conversely, two or more mutations on the same allele had mild effects when the other allele was normal.

8,9826223,Plasma homocysteine levels related to interactions between folate status and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase: a study in 52 healthy subjects.,"Hyperhomocysteinemia, a risk factor for vascular disease, is related to vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and especially folate deficiency, or to genetic factors such as mutations in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), an enzyme involved in the remethylation pathway of homocysteine to methionine. Recently, a C677 --> T mutation identified in the MTHFR gene was found to be frequently associated with decreased MTHFR activity and an elevated plasma homocysteine concentration. Since hyperhomocysteinemia seems to be determined by both genetic and environmental factors, we studied the interactions between MTHFR (phenotype and genotype) and folate status, including methyltetrahydrofolate (methylTHF), the product of MTHFR, on the homocysteine concentration in 52 healthy subjects, (28 women and 24 men; mean age, 32.7 years). MTHFR activity seems to be dependent on folate status, as shown by a lower activity in folate-deficient subjects and a return to normal values after supplementation with folic acid, and also by a decreased enzymatic activity on phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated lymphocytes grown in a folic acid-deficient medium. Conversely, the C677 --> T mutation seems to influence folate metabolism. Subjects who were homozygous for this mutation (+/+) had significantly higher plasma homocysteine and lower plasma folate and total and methylfolate levels in red blood cells (RBCs) than heterozygous (+/-) and normal (-/-) subjects. The ratio of RBC methylfolate to RBC total folate was, respectively, 0.27 in +/+, 0.66 in +/-, and 0.71 in -/-. This mutation seems to have an impact on methylTHF generation.
