This meta-analysis was conducted to study the efficacy and safety of PRC-063 for ADHD.
We searched for published trials to October 2022 in several databases.
A total of 1,215 patients from 5 RCTs were included. We observed significant improvement for PRC-063 in ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS; MD = -6.73, 95% CI [-10.34, -3.12]) compared with placebo. The effect of PRC-063 on the sleep problems due to ADHD was not statistically different from placebo. Six subscales of Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) showed no statistical significance between PRC-063 and placebo. The result showed no significant difference comparing PRC-063 with placebo in serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (RR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.03, 19.34]).

35092763","Is S100B Involved in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)? Comparisons with Controls and Changes Following a Triple Therapy Containing Methylphenidate, Melatonin and ω-3 PUFAs.","Increasing evidence supports a neuroinflammatory basis in ADHD damaging glial function and thereby altering dopaminergic (DA) neurotransmission. Previous studies focusing on the S100B protein as a marker of glial function have shown contradictory results. We conducted a clinical trial to investigate differences in S100B levels between ADHD patients and controls, as well as observe gradual changes in S100B concentrations after a triple therapy (TT) containing methylphenidate (MPH), melatonin (aMT) and omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 PUFAs).
62 medication-naïve children with ADHD (ADHD-G) and 65 healthy controls (C-G) were recruited. Serum S100B was measured at baseline (T0) in ADHD-G/C-G, and three (T3) and six months (T6) after starting TT in the ADHD-G, together with attention scores.
A significant increase in S100B was observed in the ADHD-G vs. C-G. In the ADHD-G, significantly higher S100B values were observed for comparisons between T0-T3 and between T0-T6, accompanied by a significant improvement in attention scores for the same timepoint comparisons. No significant differences were found for S100B between T3-T6.
Our results agree with the hypothesis of glial damage in ADHD. Further studies on the link between DA and S100B are required to explain the transient increase in S100B following TT.","['ADHD', 'S100B', 'attention', 'melatonin', 'methylphenidate', 'ω-3 PUFAs']",Nutrients,2023-02-12,"[{'lastname': 'Ouadih-Moran', 'firstname': 'Miriam', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Torrevieja University Hospital, 03186 Alicante, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Muñoz-Hoyos', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Granada, 18016 Granada, Spain.'}, {'lastname': ""D'Marco"", 'firstname': 'Luis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine & Surgery, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Cardenal Herrera-CEU, CEU Universities, 46115 Valencia, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Molina-Carballo', 'firstname': 'Antonio', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Granada, 18016 Granada, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Seiquer', 'firstname': 'Isabel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physiology and Biochemistry of Animal Nutrition (EEZ-CSIC), Camino del Jueves, 18100 Granada, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Checa-Ros', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine & Surgery, Faculty of Health Sciences, Universidad Cardenal Herrera-CEU, CEU Universities, 46115 Valencia, Spain.\nAston Institute of Health and Neurosciences, School of Life & Health Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham B4 7ET, UK.'}]",,Our results agree with the hypothesis of glial damage in ADHD.

4,36717325,Methylphenidate Enhances Spontaneous Fluctuations in Reward and Cognitive Control Networks in Children With Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.,"Methylphenidate, a first-line treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is thought to influence dopaminergic neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and its associated brain circuitry, but this hypothesis has yet to be systematically tested.
We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial including 27 children with ADHD. Children with ADHD were scanned twice with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging under methylphenidate and placebo conditions, along with assessment of sustained attention. We examined spontaneous neural activity in the NAc and the salience, frontoparietal, and default mode networks and their links to behavioral changes. Replicability of methylphenidate effects on spontaneous neural activity was examined in a second independent cohort.
Methylphenidate increased spontaneous neural activity in the NAc and the salience and default mode networks. Methylphenidate-induced changes in spontaneous activity patterns in the default mode network were associated with improvements in intraindividual response variability during a sustained attention task. Critically, despite differences in clinical trial protocols and data acquisition parameters, the NAc and the salience and default mode networks showed replicable patterns of methylphenidate-induced changes in spontaneous activity across two independent cohorts.
We provide reproducible evidence demonstrating that methylphenidate enhances spontaneous neural activity in NAc and cognitive control networks in children with ADHD, resulting in more stable sustained attention. Our findings identified a novel neural mechanism underlying methylphenidate treatment in ADHD to inform the development of clinically useful biomarkers for evaluating treatment outcomes.","['Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder', 'Default mode network', 'Methylphenidate', 'Nucleus accumbens', 'Salience network', 'Spontaneous neural activity']",Biological psychiatry.

5,36572273,The effects of first-dose methylphenidate on the neural signatures of visual selective attention in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.,"Although methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to significantly improve selective attention in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the neural mechanism of this effect remains unclear. We investigated the effects of first-dose MPH on the neural signatures of visual selective attention in children with ADHD. We measured the impact of first-dose MPH on electrophysiological indexes from eighteen children with ADHD (8.9-15.2 years; 15 boys) while they performed a visual search task. MPH was administered in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design. MPH led to decreases in behavioral error rates and reaction times. For the electrophysiological indexes, MPH significantly increased the target-elicited N2pc amplitude and posterior P3 amplitude during the selective attention process. The trial-based correlation analysis revealed that the enhanced N2pc (more negative) and P3 (more positive) promoted the behavioral response speed for children with ADHD. The lower individual P3 amplitude was associated with higher severity of inattention symptoms. The severer inattention symptoms were related to weaker MPH effect on N2pc amplitude. These findings suggest that N2pc and P3 are closely related to the mechanism of MPH in the ADHD treatment.","['ADHD', 'Children', 'Methylphenidate', 'N2pc', 'P3', 'Selective attention']",Biological psychology,2022-12-27,"[{'lastname': 'Guo', 'firstname': 'Jialiang', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning & IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China; School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Luo', 'firstname': 'Xiangsheng', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Peking University Sixth Hospital/Institute of Mental Health, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kong', 'firstname': 'Yuanjun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning & IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Bingkun', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning & IDG/McGovern Institute for Brain Research, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Si', 'firstname': 'Bailu', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'School of Systems Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jensen', 'firstname': 'Ole', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Human Brain Health, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Li', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Peking University Sixth Hospital/Institute of Mental Health, Beijing, China; National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), Key Laboratory of Mental Health, Ministry of Health (Peking University), Beijing, China.

35561944",Effect of methylphenidate on functional controllability: a preliminary study in medication-naïve children with ADHD.,"Methylphenidate (MPH) is the recommended first-line treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). While MPH's mechanism of action as a dopamine and noradrenaline transporter blocker is well known, how this translates to ADHD-related symptom mitigation is still unclear. As functional connectivity is reliably altered in ADHD, with recent literature indicating dysfunctional connectivity dynamics as well, one possible mechanism is through altering brain network dynamics. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled MPH crossover trial, 19 medication-naïve children with ADHD underwent two functional MRI scanning sessions (one on MPH and one on placebo) that included a resting state scan and two inhibitory control tasks; 27 typically developing (TD) children completed the same protocol without medication. Network control theory, which quantifies how brain activity reacts to system inputs based on underlying connectivity, was used to assess differences in average and modal functional controllability during rest and both tasks between TD children and children with ADHD (on and off MPH) and between children with ADHD on and off MPH. Children with ADHD on placebo exhibited higher average controllability and lower modal controllability of attention, reward, and somatomotor networks than TD children. Children with ADHD on MPH were statistically indistinguishable from TD children on almost all controllability metrics. These findings suggest that MPH may stabilize functional network dynamics in children with ADHD, both reducing reactivity of brain organization and making it easier to achieve brain states necessary for cognitively demanding tasks.",[],Translational psychiatry,2022-12-18,"[{'lastname': 'Henry', 'firstname': 'Teague R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and School of Data Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA. trhenry@virginia.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Fogleman', 'firstname': 'Nicholas D', 'initials': 'ND', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nDepartment of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nCarolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Nugiel', 'firstname': 'Tehila', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nCarolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cohen', 'firstname': 'Jessica R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nCarolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.\nBiomedical Research Imaging Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.'}]",,,,© 2022.

27785101",Association of Pharmacological Treatments and Hospitalization and Death in Individuals With Amphetamine Use Disorders in a Swedish Nationwide Cohort of 13 965 Patients.,"There are no medications approved by authorities for the treatment of amphetamine or methamphetamine dependence, and studies investigating the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments in hard outcomes, such as hospitalization and death, are lacking.
To investigate the association between pharmacotherapies and hospitalization and mortality outcomes in persons with amphetamine or methamphetamine use disorder.
This nationwide register-based cohort study was conducted from July 2006 to December 2018 with a median (IQR) follow-up time of 3.9 (1.0-6.1) years. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2021, to May 24, 2022. All residents aged 16 to 64 years living in Sweden with a registered first-time diagnosis of amphetamine or methamphetamine use disorder and without previous diagnoses of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were identified from nationwide registers of inpatient care, specialized outpatient care, sickness absence, and disability pension.
Medications for substance use disorders (SUDs) or for attention-deficit/hyperactive disorder, mood stabilizers, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and related drugs, and antipsychotics. Medication use vs nonuse was modeled with the PRE2DUP (from prescription drug purchases to drug use periods) method.
Primary outcomes were hospitalization due to SUD and any hospitalization or death, which were analyzed using within-individual models by comparing use and nonuse periods of 17 specific medications or medication classes in the same individual to minimize selection bias. The secondary outcome was all-cause mortality, studied using between-individual analysis as traditional Cox models.
There were 13 965 individuals in the cohort (9671 [69.3%] male; mean [SD] age, 34.4 [13.0] years). During follow-up, 7543 individuals (54.0%) were taking antidepressants, 6101 (43.7%) benzodiazepines, 5067 (36.3%) antipsychotics, 3941 (28.2%) ADHD medications (1511 [10.8%] were taking lisdexamphetamine), 2856 (20.5%) SUD medications, and 1706 (12.2%) mood stabilizers. A total of 10 341 patients (74.0%) were hospitalized due to SUDs, 11 492 patients (82.3%) were hospitalized due to any cause or died, and 1321 patients (9.5%) died of any cause. Lisdexamphetamine was the only medication in this study that was significantly associated with a decrease in risk of 3 outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.94 for SUD hospitalization; aHR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.95 for any hospitalization or death; aHR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.24-0.77 for all-cause mortality). Methylphenidate use also was associated with lower all-cause mortality (aHR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43-0.74). Use of benzodiazepines was associated with a significantly higher risk of SUD hospitalization (aHR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.12-1.22), any hospitalization or death (aHR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.17-1.24), and all-cause mortality (aHR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.20-1.60). Use of antidepressants or antipsychotics was associated with a slight increase in risk of SUD hospitalization (aHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.11 and aHR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09) as well as any hospitalization or death (aHR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.06-1.14 and aHR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.10, respectively).

30097390","Efficacy and safety of methylphenidate and behavioural parent training for children aged 3-5 years with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and sham behavioural parent training-controlled trial.","There is insufficient evidence to support treatment recommendations for preschool children aged 3-5 years with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of methylphenidate and behavioural parent training in reducing the frequency and severity of symptoms and improving global functioning in preschool children with ADHD.
We did an 8-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled and sham behavioural parent training-controlled clinical trial (the MAPPA Study) in children aged 3-5 years with moderate-to-severe ADHD. The trial was conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, Hospital das Clinicas, University of São Paulo Medical School, São Paulo, Brazil. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive immediate-release methylphenidate plus educational intervention (sham behavioural parent training), placebo medication plus behavioural parent training, or placebo medication plus educational intervention. Randomisation was done by an independent research manager by use of a permuted block randomisation procedure. Parents, teachers, study staff, and evaluators remained masked to group allocation. Methylphenidate and placebo were titrated to a maximum dose of 1·25 mg/kg per day administered orally twice daily, and behavioural parent training and the educational intervention were delivered weekly through 90 min sessions with both the child and parent, conducted by two psychologists or learning therapists. The primary outcomes were parents' and teachers' composite scores of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV scale (SNAP-IV-P/T), the Clinical Global Impressions Severity (CGI-S) scale, and the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02807870, and is now complete. All participants were invited to participate in an open observational follow-up, which is ongoing.
Between Aug 21, 2016, and Oct 21, 2019, 153 children were randomly assigned to receive methylphenidate plus the educational intervention (n=51), placebo plus behavioural parent training (n=51), or placebo plus the educational intervention (n=51). Nine (6%) children discontinued treatment. All participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Children in the methylphenidate plus educational intervention group showed greater reductions in the SNAP-IV-P/T (endpoint mean difference -3·93 [95% CI -7·14 to -0·73], p=0·049; effect size -0·55 [95% CI -0·99 to -0·10]) and CGI-S scores (endpoint mean difference -0·49 [-0·82 to -0·17], p=0·0088; effect size -0·70 [-1·16 to -0·24]) and a greater increase in CGAS scores (endpoint mean difference 5·25 [95% CI 2·09 to 8·40], p=0·0036; effect size 0·80 [95% CI 0·32 to 1·28]) than children in the placebo plus educational intervention group. Children in the placebo plus behavioural parent training group did not have significantly different SNAP-IV-P/T scores (endpoint mean difference -3·18 [95% CI -6·38 to 0·02], p=0·077; effect size -0·44 [95% CI -0·89 to 0·003]) or CGI-S scores (endpoint mean difference -0·35 [-0·68 to -0·03], p=0·052; effect size -0·50 [-0·96 to -0·04]) compared to children in the placebo plus educational intervention group, but they had a greater increase in CGAS scores compared to the placebo plus educational intervention group (endpoint mean difference 3·69 [0·53 to 6·85], p=0·033; effect size 0·56 [0·08 to 1·04]). Children in the methylphenidate plus educational intervention versus placebo plus behavioural parent training group did not have statistically or clinically significant differences in primary outcomes. Children in the methylphenidate plus educational intervention group had more mild adverse events than the other two groups, and there were no between-group differences for moderate or severe adverse events.
Methylphenidate was effective in reducing ADHD symptoms and improving functionality, and behavioural parent training was effective in improving functionality for preschool children with ADHD after 8 weeks of treatment.
